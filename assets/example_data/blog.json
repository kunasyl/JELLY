      "body": "It’s 5 a.m. and my mind is lit up like a Christmas tree. I’ve been glancing at the clock on the wall periodically since 1 a.m. while I panic about functioning during a workday that is fast-approaching. My daughter is sleeping next to me, peacefully, dreaming of what I hope is nothing but happiness. I hope she never experiences the nightmare my mind has been conjuring up for the past four hours.The grief, horror and hopelessness that is racing through my body grips my heart, forcing me to fixate on my fears, regrets and failures. The fact that I’m letting my daughter co-sleep with me, something I said I would never do as a new mother, feels like reminder of yet another thing I’m failing at. The truth is, living with mental illness adds many challenges to the joy of parenthood.If you have ever suffered from anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, grief or all of the above, you can probably relate. Maybe you’ve experienced the intrusive feelings of worthlessness or felt the overwhelming presence of a cloud that darkens even the brightest corners on the sunniest days. Perhaps you recall the feeling in the pit of your stomach and the tightening of your chest. Or maybe you remember the time when you couldn’t feel anything.I often think about how well we conceal this kind of pain; you can be laughing and appear “totally fine” on the outside, while feeling like everything is falling apart on the inside. Weathering the ups and downs can feel like riding a rollercoaster. Many of us know the feeling of smiling while holding back tears, waiting for the moment when it is appropriate to let it all out, maybe in the car on the drive home or in bed once your household is fast asleep.We experience the apprehension of what horrible news will come next or ruminate on how to prevent your child from ever feeling as low as you do today. Sadly, many of us feel the regret of having brought a beautiful, vibrant, happy life into this complex world — while having little control over the possible “bad things” that will happen to them during their lifetime.As I work toward recovering from a particularly rough bout of my depression, and transition through the stages of grief once again, my nights are becoming more peaceful and manageable. My emotional rollercoaster is slowing down, and my thoughts are slowly returning to hope and happiness — for both me and my daughter.I’m able to feel the joy and anticipate the amazing things that will happen to my daughter as she grows and navigates her precious life. I’m able to laugh and smile without holding back tears or dreading the return of hopelessness that lurks around the corner. I’m able to see the sunlight permeate the dark corners again, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I can breathe again.I know this won’t be the last of my depression. I’ve experienced anxiety and depression for over half my life. It’s something that could easily creep in next time I experience loss, feel shame from a mistake I’ve made or for no identifiable reason at all other than physiology and the cycles of a chronic illness.Nobody is immune to the curveballs of life, and I believe we all contend with emotional rollercoasters at times; some of us simply experience them more often and more intensely than others. My hope is that, if this resonates with you, if you are currently unable to glimpse the light around you, that you hold on and ride it out for yourself and for your children. Because it can, and does, get better. There is joy in our futures.Laura Anderson is the Adult Rehabilitative Mental Health Services (ARMHS) and aftercare supervisor for the mental health department at Creative Care for Reaching Independence (CCRI), an organization that offers community-based mental health support.

      "body": "Rosalyn Carter once said, “There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.”Caregivers, also known as “home care workers,” strengthen our communities by providing care, companionship and support for older adults and people with health conditions and disabilities. A caregiver’s work allows their clients to live at home with dignity, while providing peace of mind to their families.Like many essential roles, caregiving is physically and emotionally taxing. Amidst the demands of caring for others, caregivers’ mental health is overlooked. In fact, estimates show 40-70% of caregivers have depressive symptoms, with 25-50% of caregivers meeting criteria for major depression. This can be due to compounding stressors, like time or financial constraints, social isolation inherent to the job and limited support systems.An understanding of the unique challenges of the profession, and its structural policy gaps, can inform the work to build systems to support caregivers’ mental health.Many caregivers say they “fell into” this work but continued doing it because they found their calling. Despite the passion they feel, the challenges are significant. As Brittany Williams, a caregiver from Tacoma, Washington shared, “People don’t understand that, when you’re a caregiver, you’re literally using every part of your body and energy and strength to take care of people.”This strain was exacerbated by the COVD-19 pandemic. A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows two-thirds of unpaid caregivers experience mental health symptoms, such as depression or anxiety, compared to one-third of the non-caregiving population.While more than one in five Americans are unpaid caregivers, those who are paid — either for supporting a loved one or a client — receive modest wages. As one of health care’s lowest paid professions, caregivers may need to work long hours to make ends meet, often leading to physical and emotional exhaustion. Those caring for a loved one may navigate difficult emotions, including loss of control, isolation or the feeling that caregiving is all-consuming.Compounding these challenges is the historical reality that caregiving has been seen as the benevolent duty of female family members or the responsibility of exploited labor rather than a health care profession worth investing in. Many assumptions related to workloads and compensation that underlie caregiving have their origins in slavery, when Black women provided care without pay. These attitudes persist in today’s home care workforce in which Black women continue to be overrepresented.Additionally, caregiving was one of the few professions left out of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning generations of caregivers have been without the support and protections many workers depend on.These factors contribute to a profession that has lacked infrastructure to support the wellness of its workers who are often women of color and immigrants who may already face structural barriers to health equity and economic inclusion.Our families and communities need caregivers. And for caregivers to be successful, they (like any profession) require systems that support their well-being and sustain them in their work.We all have a role to play in building this solution. SEIU 775 Benefits Group, a nonprofit organization supporting 50,000 caregivers in Washington state through training, health, retirement and job-matching benefits that I have the honor of leading, is committed to supporting caregiver mental health in the face of the profession’s challenges and structural gaps.Here are four areas where we’ve found success — and where we hope other organizations will follow suit:Teaching skills to work with stress: One effective way to support the mental health of caregivers is to provide practical tools to work with stressors. Mindfulness has been shown to promote calm, relaxation and better sleep. By integrating mindfulness training into our courses, caregivers learn skills to identify and work through emotional challenges. Among participating caregivers, we’ve seen decreases of 20% in depression scores, 16% in perceived stress and 21% in insomnia severity.Prioritizing access to care: The ability to see an affordable therapist is often a barrier to accessing mental health support. Despite our country's advances in providing access to health care, there’s still a societal norm that high-quality care is primarily for full-time white-collar workers. But all workers need and deserve health care. In our experience, providing access to affordable, quality health care significantly shifts caregivers’ ability to proactively care for their well-being.Meeting caregivers where they are: For caregivers without health coverage or with limited insurance, high costs and long wait times present obstacles. Even those with good insurance may struggle to find culturally or linguistically appropriate therapists or feel uncomfortable seeking traditional therapy.With this in mind, we normalize emotional wellness in our communications and training and regularly connect caregivers with low-or-no-cost resources. This includes access to emotional health coaching through a third-party phone app. Of our users who screened positive for depression, 76% showed improved symptoms after six-weeks of use. Resources like these can be a game-changer for caregivers needing in-the-moment support or feeling stigma related to mental health.Focusing on economic security: Financial security lays a foundation for mental health. Yet, caregivers often don’t get this peace of mind. As a result, policies that support fair wages for caregivers, including union representation, are a crucial part of wellness. To support financial stability, we’ve adopted a first-of-its-kind retirement plan for caregivers with direct payments from their employers. And we connect caregivers to resources, such as childcare, food or legal assistance. These are important steps to reduce economic strain that can lead to mental health challenges.As the wave of aging baby boomers strains the caregiving profession and demand continues to trend upward, investments must be made to support caregivers’ well-being. Ensuring this workforce is strong, healthy and able to support our communities’ growing needs requires building systems that prioritize the wellness of caregivers, including their mental health.Abby Solomon, MSW, HCA is the CEO of SEIU 775 Benefits Group, a non-profit organization providing training, health and retirement benefits and job-matching to 50,000 caregivers in Washington state.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Until recently, I spent much of my 55 years feeling “chased” by my past, struggling to stay one step ahead of my memories. It’s a past I wanted — and needed — to run from for a long time.However, with time, I realized that I needed to heal my childhood wounds. Oftentimes, the first step in a mental health journey is to reckon with the past.In the 1970s, my father was first diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder — then called manic depression— which was treated with lithium and sometimes shock therapy. He was in his mid-twenties when he was diagnosed, as most people are when symptoms surface, and I was a young child.Living with a parent weathering the highs and lows of mania and depression was challenging. It was confusing to have a parent who, sometimes, was going to change the world, and other times, couldn’t get out of bed or make eye contact. Worse, my father could be a violent man — I suffered violent trauma at his hands more than once. One beating was so severe he had to send me out of town for a week so no one would see the black and blue evidence covering my body. Learning to live life walking on eggshells lead to much confusion, doubt and fear.When I was 11 years old, I lived alone with my father for a year. He didn’t come home one night. I later found out that he was in jail for lunging at a police officer and wrestling for his pistol, which was drawn. He spent the next four months in a mental health facility that was designated for “the criminally insane.” I was removed from my father’s custody at that point and moved far away. Except in pictures and flashbacks, I never saw my father again.Looking back, I realized I had three fathers. The angry, reckless one who used violence and fear as primary tools. Then there was the sullen, withdrawn one who laid in bed for days and listened to sad music, refusing to make eye contact and often talked about dying. Finally, there was the third father: The well-meaning, hard-working one, the poet who had vision and loved his kids. The father who was proud of his family and determined to give them a great life. Remembering this version of my father made forgiving all three fathers much easier.My father attempted to reunite with me years later, but the memories and fear were too great for me. He died when I was in my mid-twenties, which marked the beginning of three decades of flashbacks, panic attacks, bouts of alcohol consumption and even the occasional suicidal thought.I hid this pain well, most of the time. I tried some therapy, which was helpful, but struggled to stick with it for long. More than anything, I immersed myself in my career, academics and athletics. A distracted mind is one that can stay a step ahead of the past.However, everything changed when the COVID-19 pandemic began. My days went from being 95% full to just 5% full. For the first time, I was alone with my thoughts. When the initial shock of the pandemic wore off, and I couldn’t distract myself by looking outward, I was forced to do what I needed to do — to look inward.In January 2022, I began listening to a podcast about being able to detach from traumatic life events. Suddenly, and all at once, the sporadic therapy, the yoga, the podcasts, my own stubbornness — they all came together in an epiphany about letting go. Embracing this new approach meant I could re-visit traumatic events, instead of feeling constantly forced to re-live them in flashbacks. What a truly liberating feeling.I decided to learn more about Bipolar 2 and what determined some of my father’s behavior. How could he have ever thought it was a good idea to lunge for a cop’s gun? I often wondered. It was an enlightening day for me when I learned that people with Bipolar 2 often have an inability to comprehend the gravity of their decisions when they are in the grips of hyper-mania.While revisiting my trauma was difficult, I found solace in knowing my father had been sick when he was violent. I have come to believe that had he fully understood the consequences of his actions, he wouldn’t have been so brutal and unpredictable. This thinking allowed me to find forgiveness, adding to my new liberation. Being able to acknowledge the past and forgive has been a major step toward peace and fulfillment.I still have much mental health work to do, and I have committed myself to the following:I realize that, while I may have made great strides and had great awakenings in a short time, healing is a long-term process. All my efforts, everything I did to try to help myself, were all steps to get me where I need to be. It took me a long time to get here but I never gave up. It takes hard work and persistence to conquer trauma, but I got there, and I’m confident others can, too.Cam Scholey, MBA, CPA, is a professional writer and speaker.

      "body": "“What’s wrong with me?”That’s what my son, Ben, blurted out one day outside at his preschool. He was four years old at the time. He couldn’t tell me why he asked the question, so I tucked the incident away. Looking back, I realize that this was one of many incidents and behaviors throughout Ben’s childhood and teen years that I would tuck away, ignoring my gut instinct that he needed tools to better cope with his outbursts, intense thoughts and general sadness.Years (and many life lessons) later, I have reflected on what I wish I had done for my son to better support him as he navigated mental health challenges.Ben’s struggles began at birth with inconsolable crying. Medical professionals used the vague term “colic” to describe the hours and hours of evening crying for which there seemed to be no apparent cause or cure. (Much later I would read about a correlation between colic as a baby and mental illness). However, when Ben was about four months old, this exhausting behavior stopped and he grew, evolving as a curious, fun little guy. I assumed that things had become “normal,” and I had nothing to worry about.However, Ben would go on to face numerous mental health setbacks. Throughout elementary, middle and high school, he regularly saw a therapist and paid intermittent visits to a parenting coordinator, due to an extremely tricky, volatile divorce. I wondered if his emotional struggles were exacerbated by (or linked to) his father’s bipolar disorder diagnosis. Often, when Ben would return from a weekend visit with his biological father, he appeared agitated and was prone to outbursts or distancing behavior. He did will academically, and he had a few friends throughout school, but he lagged behind his peers emotionally and socially. I always felt that he was hard to read, as his behavior could be unpredictable.Ben expressed the pain he was experiencing in concrete terms — but I found ways to rationalize and tuck away what was in front of me. His high school senior year extended essay (a requirement to graduate with a specialized high school diploma) was titled, “Childhood Trauma and the Severity of Bipolar Disorder as an Adult.” In the piece, he wrote:“…Take, for example, a divorce. With divorce rates occurring at about one in every two marriages, it is not uncommon to find a child from divorced parents. At a young age, this can be very traumatic... This stress could cause night terrors, which in turn could cause an obsession with gore. This could also cause depression to become evident, and, paired with irritability, would cause warning flags to be raised. However, while a traumatic event such as a divorce could cause these behaviors, a therapist might write the entire thing off as unhappiness from the divorce. While simply talking to a therapist would help in the short run, the treatment may not be appropriate, and the child might struggle with depression until the disorder was properly diagnosed.”Looking back, I can see that my son was writing about his experience in plain sight. While I saw the words on the page at the time, I ignored my instincts again. Instead, I intellectualized the situation and kept Ben’s words at arm’s length. I also continued to accept his therapist’s perspective that we must not assume Ben was suffering just because his biological father had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But Ben’s words seemed to tell a different story.Now, almost 10 years later, Ben tries to portray someone who is not suffering with symptoms of mental illness. I call this his “I’m ok” persona; he often says, “I’m fine,” when I know he’s not. I can see the way he suffers, battling severe insomnia, hygiene problems, mood fluctuations and unhealthy amounts of screen time. As a parent, I am pained to see him living with these quality-of-life inhibitors that he is not yet ready to address.When my son asked, “What’s wrong with me?!” as a preschooler, I couldn’t answer his question — but I knew he wanted help. He truly wanted to know what was wrong, but I simply wasn’t equipped to know or answer him. I often wonder how many parents travel this long, winding road: from awareness that an illness is affecting their child, to, perhaps, ignoring signs through denial, to a desperate realization that their child needs help and attempting to navigate the health care system for an illness that is so difficult to diagnose and treat.As Ben aged, I worried about health insurance; would he be able to access the necessary care once he turned 26 and was no longer on our family insurance plan? Ben recently turned 26 and, thankfully, he has a job and health insurance. For now. But we have a long road ahead of us. Does he still wonder “what’s wrong?” If he asks himself again, I can only hope that this time, he’ll want — and get — his question answered.Elise Cassie is the mother of two beautiful children, ages 26 and 18.

      "body": "This month marks my son Jacob’s 22nd year with schizophrenia. I am happy to announce that he has been one of the fortunate people who achieved the American Psychological Association's definition of recovery: good health, a stable home, meaningful work and community participation. Does he still carry remnants of the illness? Yes. But he is living an independent, productive life that was seldom possible 60 years ago.Along the way, my husband and I have learned critical lessons about caregiving as we navigated this journey with Jacob. Even as a psychologist, I had much to learn — not only about schizophrenia, but about ways in which caretakers can be an important part of the recovery process. While my husband and I do not claim to have all the answers, we believe that what we have learned could be helpful to other families coping with the challenges for caring for a loved one with mental illness.If possible, you’ll want to be an active participant in your loved one’s care. It is very common, now, for mental health professionals to include family members in the recovery process. Research shows that family support both aids recovery and can even prevent frequent relapses. Being part of the treatment team does not mean that you will attend every therapy session or that your loved one does not have the privilege of keeping some parts of their treatment private. It simply means that you have an opportunity to learn how to best promote the healing process and what role you can take in your loved one’s treatment plan to improve their experience. This could mean providing informed emotional support or taking on more logistical tasks, depending on what your loved one needs.One specific step that a family member or caregiver could take is to create a timeline and treatment log. Since someone with a serious mental illness (SMI) may need medical and psychological care throughout their lives in various degrees of intensity, doctors or therapists may retire, move or change agencies and insurance plans. Having a timeline to carry with you from one mental health practitioner to the next with information about medications, side effects and behavioral interventions (including what worked or did not work) could be useful to the new team member.We quickly learned that caregivers need support from a like-minded community. Simply put: Find a support group for yourself. My husband and I greatly benefited from NAMI's Family-to-Family Program, which connected us with other families navigating the challenges of mental illness. There are plenty of other support group options as well, many of which are virtual for those who are conscious of COVID-19 exposure. Ultimately, we found that contact with other families going through similar experiences can break the isolation that so many of us feel while coping with a family member's mental illness.Even now, some of our friends and family still do not understand mental illness, and it helps to be around those who truly do. A group can offer a place to share your sadness, frustration or good news. And it also needs to be a place to find good ideas and strategies for coping as a family. To avoid burnout, you need a place to express your feelings and people who may be able to help you find new directions to assist you and your loved one.Our family learned that it is often helpful to celebrate any positive changes that you observe in your loved one's symptoms or behaviors — whether the improvements are big or small. Sometimes this can be challenging, but it is an important perspective to cultivate for everyone’s emotional well-being. For instance, maybe your son is brushing his teeth again; perhaps a strange thing to celebrate if he is 20 or 30 years old, but this small change could be an important step for him to start practicing self-care again. Or maybe the newest medication has finally eliminated all negative voices — a big change to celebrate. By recognizing the small and the big accomplishments, you can highlight the hope (and even joy) in the recovery process.Truly, hope is what allows us to move forward. Because schizophrenia can be a complex and confusing illness, looking for rays of hope along the way is essential. I wished that I had known 22 years ago that Jacob would get better. That he would find happiness — and so would we.Having hope isn’t naïve; treatment for SMI is improving over time, and we are constantly learning new information. 60 years ago, options for people with schizophrenia were, quite frankly, dismal. Most were either hospitalized or heavily sedated with medication. Thanks to newer medical and psychological treatment approaches, 60% of people with schizophrenia achieve a level of recovery that allows them to lead productive lives.While we have a long way to go in terms of learning the origins of this illness and meeting the needs of those living with this condition, opportunities have greatly improved. Science continues to identify new medical approaches and mental health advocates are working hard to change social and political structures — paving the way for a world in which we are not burdened by stigma and limited access to care. With this momentum, the future looks bright.Linda Snow-Griffin is a retired psychologist, mental health advocate and mother of an adult son with schizophrenia.

Rural communities are typically small and friendly — and the people are fiercely independent, yet quick to come together and help their neighbors in need.Over the years, however, I was aware that there was something going on in my small farming community that people kept hidden — a taboo topic. As I eventually discovered that there were people in my community who had a relative or a friend living with an untreated mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Yet, their struggles were met with silence because in this community — like in much of rural America — there was little information and few, if any, resources available.The wake-up call for me and my family was in 2012 with the suicide of my 28-year-old nephew, Brooks. Like so many people who live in small towns and remote areas of our country, my beloved nephew kept his suffering to himself and couldn’t bring himself to ask for help. Now, my mission is to end the suffering, silence and stigma around mental illness in rural America.The third Thursday of every November has been designated as National Rural Health Day — a day dedicated to addressing the unique health care challenges that rural residents face. Mental health is an integral part of overall health, but this critical component of our well-being is often overlooked in rural America.Rural Americans experience higher rates of depression and suicide than people who live in urban areas, but they are less likely to access mental health care services. Suicide rates among people living in rural areas are 18.3 to 20.5 per 100,000 residents — much higher than rates among people living in large urban areas (10.9 per 100,000). In addition, many rural communities have a shortage of health care providers. The following findings are a cause for concern:Mental health challenges are often made worse when coupled with other health conditions. (Comorbidities can also exacerbate an existing mental illness). The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on mental health in rural America, with 53% of rural adults and 71% of younger rural adults between the ages of 18 and 34 years reporting that the pandemic has affected their mental health.Beyond the lack of mental health resources, people living in rural areas face unique lifestyle barriers that play a role in determining whether they get the mental health care they need. They often fear negative judgement from family, friends and members of their communities (concerns include being perceived as weak or ”incompetent” if they admit to having a mental health condition). As members of small, close-knit communities, many rural residents also worry about being able to maintain confidentiality concerning a mental illness.Other rural lifestyle challenges to mental health include:The stigma associated with mental health challenges can be a major barrier to seeking help for many people living in rural communities. Some people don’t readily understand or accept that mental illness is a legitimate medical condition but rather view it as a personal weakness or character flaw. Much of the stigma surrounding mental illness is a result of this unwarranted shame, which adds to the burden for someone already suffering from mental illness.After Brooks’ passing, many of our friends and neighbors urged my family not to talk about what really happened to my nephew, to instead say that he died from natural causes. But my mother, the matriarch of our family, insisted on confronting this issue to make sure it didn’t happen to anyone else in our community.I was given the privilege of delivering Brooks’ eulogy, and I spoke in detail as to what led to his untimely death. Following the service, we had several other farm families approach us about their own journeys in dealing with mental illness and thanked us for finally giving them permission to talk openly and freely about it.Increasing awareness that mental illness is a health condition — just like cancer, heart disease or diabetes — is one way to help overcome the stigma in rural communities. In addition, talking openly with others about lived experiences with mental health challenges helps to normalize the conversation and diffuse the stigma surrounding mental illness. The simple act of sharing stories can be an important first step for people to seek help for their own mental health challenges and encourage others to admit that they are struggling.It took my nephew’s death to be my family’s wake up call, and for me to come forward and provide a voice for the often-forgotten people of rural America. While some members of our community had wanted to sweep my nephew’s tragic passing under the rug, my mom took a bold stand to talk about it with the goal of helping others. I carry on this legacy today through Rural Minds, a nonprofit organization that is committed to making a difference by pulling back the veil of silence about mental illness in rural communities.As we move forward at Rural Minds to fulfill this mission, we recognize that there are established mental health organizations, like NAMI, that provide excellent mental health information and services. Through collaboration, we are working to develop mental health initiatives to better serve the mental health needs of people in rural communities and empower rural Americans with the resources to become part of the solution to improving mental health.Jeff Winton is the Founder and Chairman of Rural Minds, a nonprofit organization that aims to end the suffering, silence and stigma surrounding mental illness in rural America. He is also the founder and owner of Wall Street Dairy, LLC — a working dairy farm in Chautauqua County, New York — and a member of a multigenerational farm family. In addition, he is the chief executive officer of Jeff Winton Associates, a full-service communications and corporate affairs agency he co-founded in 2020.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I am a suicide loss survivor. I have lost three family members to suicide — my cousin Craig in 2011 and his son, Aaron, in 2014. I also lost my dad, Dan, in 2012. I have felt all these losses deeply, and more than 10 years later, I still have moments that take me back to those first minutes of hearing about their deaths. I have come to the painful realization that reaching some type of “closure” from these losses is a myth. These tragedies, like other major experiences in my life, will be with me indefinitely.Losing someone to suicide is different from other types of loss, largely because of the stigma surrounding mental illness. While people won’t hesitate to discuss someone’s brave battle with cancer and include that in an obituary, those who die by suicide are often surrounded by secrecy and vague statements about how they died. The loss might even be labeled as an “accident.”Those affected by the loss may also feel isolated and alone because people who would typically be supportive during a tragedy don’t know what to do or say when a suicide occurs. The trauma associated with being a suicide loss survivor and its resulting effects can create a tough road to navigate.Every year, I see more and more groups and individuals spreading the message about suicide prevention. I applaud these efforts and admire the passion for creating a proactive approach to mental health. I also think it’s important to reflect on where we have been and what led us to this point of openly talking about it.While it would be hard to measure exact numbers, my suspicion is that most of us who are involved in suicide prevention have been touched by suicide in some way. For every suicide loss, there is an even larger number of people that are impacted by that loss. It makes sense to me that suicide loss survivors would forward a message of prevention so that others would not have to go through what they did.However, this connection brings to light a reality that I think we should all consider: Suicide is complex — there are no simple answers that explain why people die by suicide. Research is ongoing and progress is being made, but I encourage all of us to be careful about oversimplifying a message that ultimately cannot be simplified.I write these words as a reminder to myself as well because I have done this in my activism too, particularly when sharing suicide prevention messaging on social media. Other times, I have spoken of suicide in ways that try to avoid making someone uncomfortable and promote a positivity that’s not realistic. Prevention (and the hope that accompanies it) is the goal, but many suicide loss survivors understand that we are not there yet.I also want to encourage every suicide loss survivor to take some extra time to remember those we’ve lost and share some joyful stories and memories of their lives. We understand that they shouldn’t be defined solely by how they died, but for the multifaceted people that they were — just as we would happily recall the life of someone who died from a physical illness. In prevention efforts and a growing mental health conversation, there is plenty of room to include remembering, talking about and sharing our love for those we have lost to suicide as well.Craig, Aaron, my dad and I all were raised in the same town, and we spent a lot of time together. Craig was very active in the community, including in his work as a volunteer firefighter. Aaron was an outgoing young adult that could make anyone laugh. My dad was an avid hunter and considered me and my brother to be his biggest accomplishments. I miss and love them all — and that never changes.About a year or so after my dad died, I decided to use my experience to join NAMI and become a teacher for the NAMI Family-to-Family course. After teaching a few classes, I became involved in NAMI Walks as well. I joined the Board of Directors for NAMI Iowa and served as the president for a few years. During that time, I was involved in advocacy efforts at the Iowa State Legislature and contributed to multiple fundraising events. When the NAMI Provider course was offered to third-year medical students at Des Moines University, I jumped at the chance to teach again.More recently, I completed my first American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) Overnight Walk in New York City and attended AFSP’s Long Term Survivors of Suicide Loss Summit in Cleveland. Although my family’s losses are still difficult to process, I have found a way to make meaning from them to raise awareness, educate, advocate and support.While I will never forget the loss of Craig, Aaron and my dad, I choose to remember them by sharing my story and promoting a message of hope. We haven’t reached the goal of 100% suicide prevention yet, but every day we take a few steps forward to someday make it a reality.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.“What if it changes you?” I said, holding back tears. The next day, my husband Isaac would be going on his first deployment to Iraq. It was 2009. We had been married for over two years and had a 12-month-old daughter. Losing the man I married — my rock and best friend — was one of my biggest fears.Those fears were realized when he returned home early from Afghanistan in 2013. He was injured; physically, mentally and emotionally. To make matters even more challenging, I developed secondary PTSD — when the loved one of someone dealing with PTSD starts to exhibit those same symptoms, including hypervigilance, anxiety, avoidance, nightmares, trouble sleeping, impatience, etc.It took years of therapy and support from other veterans and caregivers we met through Wounded Warrior Project to find ourselves — and each other — again.Injuries and trauma sustained during training and combat can change a person. Gone was the driven, reliable, caring and stable husband I married. Instead, he was angry, exhausted, moody and distant. I felt like I was living with a stranger.Neither of us understood the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In my husband’s small military community, invisible wounds carried a stigma. He worried he would be ostracized from his command and forced to medically retire from the career he loved. Shame, guilt and depression overcame him. It crushed him.I stopped him from two suicide attempts — something I never thought my strong husband would even contemplate, let alone try.Both times he attempted suicide, my husband was afraid of what his command would think — and how they would respond to his mental struggles. By this time, he erupted in angry outbursts over the smallest things. He started punching doors and walls when we would have disagreements. I became fearful of these fits of rage.We decided to live separately for a short time. Isaac focused on his treatments, and I focused on getting back into my fitness career, so I could financially support our family.Years of walking on eggshells and trying to keep the peace in the war that came home to us started taking a toll on my health. In 2016, I started having severe panic attacks. I worked 50-plus hours a week, managing a fitness department while also taking care of my husband’s medical needs and caring for our three children. The burden was overwhelming.I felt all alone.I was cracking, but who could take care of me? No one understood the struggles I was facing. I started to isolate myself, which only made me feel worse and depressed. I found myself in the emergency room several times.What I didn’t realize was these were similar to the struggles my husband had been plagued with for years. For the first time, I got a glimpse of his daily challenges. It fueled me to get help for both of us.This led me to Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP). I learned that I was not alone.I started to attend family support events. In May 2017, I attended a dinner with others who understood what I was going through.It was through WWP that I learned about secondary PTSD. Finally, I had a name for the symptoms I was experiencing. I realized we both needed treatment to heal ourselves, our marriage and our family.At that same dinner, I learned we could get a year’s worth of therapy in a three-week intensive outpatient program called Warrior Care Network. The program helps wounded warriors and their family support members heal from the invisible wounds of PTSD and TBI.At first, my husband was not comfortable doing more treatments. He had already been through other options with little to no improvement. However, he saw my progress as I dealt with secondary PTSD. It inspired him to fully commit to his recovery and healing. So, in April 2019, we embarked on our three-week treatment, which was a turning point for us.In this treatment program, we grew together, navigating this new normal in our lives. We were given tools and skills for when our symptoms flared. We also learned to communicate again through our changing roles. We even had our first experience with equine therapy. It sparked a dream in us.In April of this year, that dream became a reality.We purchased a 15-acre property and farmhouse. One day, we hope to help other veterans and caregivers overcome invisible wounds through equine therapy. I am getting my master’s degree in social work and becoming an equine therapist. We adopted two handsome horses. They are our best counselors.Now, when my husband has a difficult day, I’ll find him grooming his horse, Dempsey. I smile because we are moving forward with our lives. No, the symptoms of our mental health struggles aren’t gone. Yes, we still work at it daily, but it makes all the sacrifices of this life together worth it.As we navigated this difficult journey, I chose to not take his PTSD and traumatic brain injury outbursts personally. I continue to be joyful. I chose to fight for his quality of life, our marriage and our family with everything I had. I am so blessed that it has brought us here. My husband may never be the exact man I married again. I have learned it's ok because I have the best gift of falling in love with him every day.Jenna Malone lives in Florida with her three children and husband, Navy veteran Isaac Malone.

      "body": "Telling your partner about your mental health diagnosis is a big step in a relationship that is often met with anxiety, uncertainty and fear. I have first-hand experience telling the person I saw myself spending the rest of my life with that I have a serious mental illness and will be taking antipsychotic medications for the rest of my life.Here is what I have learned through my process disclosing my schizophrenia diagnosis to the man who is now my husband. I hope that my experience — and what I wish I had known — can help guide others who are making this important, brave decision.If you have the desire to share this type of information with someone, it is a sign that this person is special. Your wish to disclose likely means that you want to be real and transparent with them — to achieve greater intimacy for the purpose of a long-term relationship.If I could go back, I would tell myself that sharing this information in the first place is actually a privilege and honor to your partner. Whoever you choose to tell is fortunate to know this information. A good partner will understand the significance of you thinking highly enough of them to disclose sensitive information that leaves you vulnerable. So, the right person will see your disclosure as a good thing. And your vulnerability speaks volumes about the strength of your relationship.Understandably, you may not want to disclose because you do not know how your partner will react. Even if you don’t know how they will react, it doesn’t mean they aren’t the right person – you may just not know for sure what they know or think about mental illness. Perhaps they don’t have any first-hand experience with mental illness, and they might unintentionally see your diagnosis through the lens of stigma. It’s normal to worry that their limited experience might lead them to see you differently. Personally, I feared for the first time my partner would find out that I wasn’t “perfect,” or worse, that I have a “problem.”I understand why disclosing this information is so hard. Maybe your relationship is the best thing to happen to you in a long time, and you don’t want to take the risk. Of course, it would be painful to find out that your partner doesn’t accept you and your diagnosis. Rejection can make us feel as though our past and current mental health status keeps us from finding the love and happiness we are looking for. We don’t want someone to look at us and worry that we could be untrustworthy or relapse.However, it’s better to know sooner if your partner would reject you as you don’t want to waste your time with someone who won’t accept your illness. Your time is just as precious as your partner’s, and you won’t truly know if your partner is the right person for you until they know and accept you fully — including your diagnosis.The truth is: while your illness does not define or identify you, the act of hiding information about yourself is emotionally draining. Concealing information about yourself takes energy that could be directed to growing your relationship instead. Beyond the exhaustion of hiding a diagnosis, you will likely experience undue anxiety about your partner finding out before you decide to tell them.From my experience, I can say that withholding that information can slow down or impede your relationship. By resisting sharing my diagnosis, I was putting the brakes on my relationship without meaning to; I was holding back, afraid of him rejecting me and my mental illness history.I revealed information incrementally over the course of two years, because I wanted my partner to really get to know me — and he could see how well I was doing despite the challenging diagnosis. While this method certainly led to a successful relationship, I still wish I had disclosed sooner.Ultimately, the right partner will admire your courage to face your illness and your persistence to seek treatment. They will know your limitations and imperfections — and they will love those parts of you as well.In the process of disclosing my diagnosis and growing my relationship with my partner, I realized that not having a picture-perfect past has turned into a gift. I know I am loved, regardless of societal stigma, hospitalizations and labels. I feel so fortunate to experience a kind of unconditional love that surrounds me regardless of setbacks — and I would prefer that to being considered “perfect.” Now, I know my husband fully knows and accepts me for exactly who I am, and my disclosure gave him the opportunity to show how much he loves me and believes in me.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "My son is a missing person. His face doesn’t appear on the back of a milk carton or on a flyer at the post office, but he’s missing, nonetheless.I haven’t seen him in over two years, and I don’t know if I will ever see him again.But I hear from him every day. He calls regularly. In fact, he calls too often. He wants to tell me about his suffering: his left leg that he’s sure is shorter than the right one, his eyebrow that twitches, the microbe under his thigh, the neighbors who are listening to him, the mailman who wants to harm him. The list of his troubles always goes on even though it changes constantly.I suppose I should be happy that I hear from him. At least I know he’s alive and well enough to worry about these things. But I miss him — and I want him back.Two years ago, my son fled through his apartment window. Like a thief making a quick getaway, he climbed out of the window with a duffle bag full of clothes, his laptop and his phone. I didn’t think it was possible for him to get away. The window was small. His apartment was on a major street. But when I showed up with the police, a locksmith and a social worker, he knew I was there to have him hospitalized. That compelled him to find a way to escape — by any means necessary.Being hospitalized was, and still is, his greatest fear. That’s why he evades me and the rest of his family, the people he’s closest to. He knows we’ll try to get him inpatient treatment again if we get the chance. That’s why, when he saw me with his would-be “captors,” he took off. First on foot, then by bus and train and, eventually, by plane.His movements surprised me. I thought someone with his appearance — a mass of hair on his head, a long beard and fingernails that look like claws — would draw suspicion during his travels. He looks nothing like the handsome young man in his passport photo. But so far, no one has tried to intervene.After a week of traveling, he turned up in Anchorage. We knew because we could monitor his movements through his cell phone. The extent of his travel was an amazing feat for someone who experiences paranoia and delusions much of the time. He told me he went to Alaska because it was too hot in Los Angeles, and he wanted to live someplace cool. He said he chose Alaska because he needed to live in a state that began with the letter A, the same as his first name. Arizona and Alabama are too hot, so Alaska was his best option. Besides, it was far from me and the rest of his family.My son is missing — not because he was abducted, but by choice, his and mine. I could find him if I wanted to. He’s gone, but financially dependent on me. I could withhold support until he agreed to see me. But what good would that do? I can’t force him to do anything — cutting off support would simply ensure that he struggled financially, as well as emotionally. He calls me often, because he is bored, lonely and suffering. He calls because I will answer. In fact, he calls me every day.I listen as he tells me his fears and ailments, but he rejects my advice for treatment, especially if it involves seeing a doctor. He won’t accept my suggestion to take a walk outside because he never leaves his apartment. He’s afraid of the dangers his mind conjures up.So, he stays inside and calls his uncles, aunts, cousins, old friends, classmates from grade school that he can track down through social media and co-workers who forgot about him years ago. He’s desperate for someone who will listen to him, and he’s running out of options. The number of those who are willing to speak with him has shrunk with time because all his contacts are moving on with their lives, and not many are able to handle hearing his difficulties.My son has taught me a painful lesson: to accept the things I cannot change. It took me some time to embrace the lesson, but once I did, it eased my own suffering. A few years ago, a friend told me not to worry about my son. “Worry isn’t good for you or him. Be concerned, but don’t worry because there’s not much you can do.”Doctors have told me to be happy for what we have. He’s not living on the streets. He hasn’t been beaten up or arrested. He knows how to cook for himself, order food online and manage the life he has. “You should be grateful,” a well-regarded psychiatrist told me recently. “It could be far worse.”It’s hard to imagine, but I suppose he’s right. I see so many people, especially young men of color like my son, living on the streets of Los Angeles; battling psychosis and suffering. When I see them, I give thanks that my son isn’t out there too.Still, I miss him, especially the son I knew when he was a child. He was sweet, thoughtful, kind and a pleasure to be with. But he’s gone — and I must accept that I may never get him back. We spoke this morning, and he was in a good mood. In fact, he laughed when I said hello because he thought there was an echo. Then he began telling me his current list of problems. I listened, just happy to know that he’s alive and as ok as he will be for some time to come.Pedro Noguera, Ph.D. is the Dean of the Rossier School of Education at USC.

      "body": "For better or for worse, our parents and caregivers offer us our first and most lasting insights into the workings of being human. From the ages of three, when I first immigrated to the U.S., to eleven, I lived in a household of seven people. The men — my uncle and father — were omnipotent shades in the background. My cousin and I, the children, didn’t see them much. We just knew they were the ones to please — and the ones to avoid angering.My grandmother, mother and aunt — the women — were the ones around to pick up the day-to-day pieces. We relied on them for everything and took it all for granted. They slipped into this hierarchy they had no say in building with the same tired smoothness they used to slip through the front door after a long workday (that often exceeded the men’s workdays).The women knew the means to survival but not living. Perhaps seeing their conditioned acceptance to the blood-thick misogyny of everything in that house determined the philosophy by which I shaped myself: you are the sum of what you can do for others.In popular culture and media, we see an abundance of content related to “generational curses” that catalyze the protagonist’s journey. We’ve come to view them in the context of a set narrative rather than lived experience. The hero comes into their blood-ordained power for the first time. They grapple with it. They grow into it. They become the stuff of legends, and we can all applaud from the other side of the screen, fulfilled by the predictable satisfaction evoked by a happy ending. Intergenerational trauma is considerably more nuanced — there is no clear hero or villain, victor or victim.I love my mother. That’s the one thing I can say with certainty. Most days, however, I don’t know if I like her — and I’m sure she’d say the same about me. This is because I’m acutely aware of the fact that many, if not all, of my mental health struggles can easily be traced back to her: my anxiety, terrible body image and depression.Currently, I identify as a socially anxious introvert with an extraordinarily low battery for interaction. But the truth is, I was a relatively happy child. My home life was challenging, but I was insulated from much of the direct harm through the efforts of my mother and grandmother, for which I am forever grateful. In elementary school, I was a confident and outgoing extrovert who never had any doubts about her ability to make and maintain friendships.However, things changed when my parents divorced. My mother and I suffered. Our relationship was rocky for all of my middle school and half of my high school years. She was always working to support the two of us. I lingered in solitude for most of my adolescence and felt abandoned because of it. Being an immigrant, a single mother, and a woman of color in a racialized and fractured society is obviously not an easy task to take on. My mother was stressed, but she wouldn’t communicate. Our interactions grew strained; I would feel anxious about her coming home and picking me apart. Among this wreckage, no venerated champion emerged — only mother and daughter standing side-by-side.My experiences with intergenerational trauma inspired me in my third year of college to pursue a service-learning fellowship with Little Manila Rising, a Filipinx-based non-profit focused on bringing multi-faceted equity to the historically disenfranchised region of South Stockton. I devoted forty hours a week to the fellowship, the bulk of which was spent assisting in their Healing Pilipinx Uplifting Self and Others (PUSO) program.Healing PUSO’s commitment to destigmatizing conversations around trauma-informed and culturally competent mental health care completely shifted my worldview. For many years, I thought mental health could be summed up simply by “self-care,” “therapy” and “diagnosis.” I had no critical framework for grasping the systemic factors at play, the importance of intersectionality or the psychosocial effects of inherited historical trauma and generational marginalization.This newfound vocabulary enabled me for the first time in my life to name my experiences. It gave me the power to give them shape. More importantly, it grounded me in community. I felt so alone with my thoughts for too long. Now I know my complicated mother-daughter relationship is not an isolated one. Rather, it mirrors the struggles many immigrants and people of color face in being tasked with reconciling cultures, belief-systems and many generations of pain.As I time travel through these words, revisiting the many phases of my life, I’d like to say that besides being older, I’ve also grown wiser through the years. I will turn 21 this year. At 21, my mom was working full-time in the city, alone and away from her loved ones, to support herself and help her parents. At almost 21, I’ve never understood my mom more.Today, as a NAMI Next Gen Youth Advisor, I advocate as a representative of myself and the women who came before me who lacked the space, vocabulary and visibility necessary to incite meaningful and necessary change. I am privileged beyond words to occupy a role that I never thought was in the cards for people who looked like me growing up. Breaking cycles while breaking stigma — that’s what I’m here for.Guiying (Angel) Zhong is a current undergraduate student at the University of the Pacific majoring in Psychology and English and minoring in Writing and Ethnic Studies.

      "body": "Around three years ago, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). I was attending “regular therapy,” as I like to call it, for about five and a half years — on and off with different therapists, at different clinics, and taking several medications. Eventually, I settled with one therapist. But after a year and a half of being together, she told me I would need to transfer at a different clinic where I would receive more intensive therapy. She also mentioned BPD for the first time.I hadn’t heard of this disorder before, and I wasn’t familiar with its symptoms or manifestations. It was brand new to me. What I did know was that being told to switch clinics for different treatment was hurtful. I cried during my last session, and when my therapist asked me why I was crying, I didn’t even know how to explain what I was feeling.However, after receiving this diagnosis and trying dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for some time, I began to make progress and feel more at peace. Since starting this treatment, I have learned to recognize and sit with my emotions. Developing strategies to acknowledge my feelings has helped me accept my circumstances and live a happier life, even with its struggles.As I reflect on what I’ve learned on my ongoing mental health journey, a few lessons stick out:The fear and hurt I felt that day in my therapist’s office was familiar — I believed my therapist got tired of me and my lack of progress and hoped to get rid of me with this transfer — and it was a kind of pain I had always felt. Throughout middle school and high school, I found myself in toxic and unstable friendships, and I always felt like I was the problem.I would lash out at my friends because I often felt jealous, and I feared I would be replaced by “better people.” I had a falling out with someone I considered to be my best friend, due to my own behavior, but I blamed her for the demise of our friendship and resented her for the loneliness and pain I was experiencing. I continued to struggle to make friends. So, whenever someone new entered my life, I would do everything in power to “keep” them — even if the actual friendship was not good for me.When I entered a romantic relationship in high school, new unhealthy behaviors emerged. I believed this person was “the one,” and I constantly prioritized him so he wouldn’t leave me. Even when I was not treated well and the relationship took a toll on my well-being and the people around me, I still directed all my attention toward him, hoping he would change one day. Thankfully, this relationship did end eventually. But during that time, I would catch myself “missing” him — or to be exact, missing the feeling of having someone.As I reflect on my history, I realize that I hated the thought of anyone leaving my life and feared any kind of change. Any time someone important left my life, my world came crashing down — and I was constantly living in the past. When I was eventually evaluated and officially diagnosed with BPD, I felt like all the confusing and painful events of my adolescence and beyond finally made sense.Upon hearing the symptoms that led to my diagnosis, I felt something click. I found relief in finally knowing what was wrong — and what solutions were available to me. This diagnosis could explain some of my overwhelming feelings and fears of abandonment. It explained feelings of emptiness and self-hatred. It all finally made sense.When I attended my standard psychotherapy appointments, I often like I was in a hole. I was stuck and simply couldn’t make progress. I returned to harmful behaviors and wondered why I couldn’t change.It turns out that what I needed most was to learn how to cope with difficult emotions — something I practiced in DBT. At first, I wasn’t enthusiastic about this kind of therapy, but with time, I came to realize the value of practicing daily mindfulness rather than ignoring my emotions until moments of crisis.I also learned specific skills to put into practice when I’m struggling to manage my feelings. On skill that particularly stands out is DEARMAN — an acronym that stands for Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce, Mindful, Appear confident and Negotiate. Following the steps described in this skill has guided me in effective communication when I’m emotionally overwhelmed or activated and feel the impulse to shut down.Another skill that I rely on is simply “checking the facts.” This entails breaking down a situation and separating the facts from your emotions and beliefs. When I’m seeing things in black and white or struggling to grasp what’s “real,” taking this step back to assess the situation brings some calm and clarity. It challenges me to recognize my emotions, observe my surroundings and view the situation from other points of view. This work can be intimidating, but I practiced this kind of mindfulness regularly, I started seeing positive changes in my life.Despite finding the right treatment, managing my mental health condition is an ongoing battle. Sometimes, I wish I had known how hard this work would be. How difficult it is to acknowledge feelings of pain and emptiness and explore their origins. How difficult it is to manage your fears of losing those close to you because of your intensity. How hard it is to be told your behavior is “toxic” or “possessive.”But I’ve also learned that I have a chance to fight stigma surrounding BPD. I have come to understand just how damaging stigma can be; indeed, finding your identity can be difficult when the world reduces you to your symptoms. These daily battles are overwhelming, but I know I can’t give up. I can change how people see this condition, and I can fight for my own well-being.To those who also have BPD, we are not alone and its always ok to reach out. Take it day by day; recovery is not something that should be rushed. And remember: progress is progress, no matter how small it may seem.Lizbeth Desantiago is 19 years old and loves learning about mental health and psychology.

      "body": "I live in an apartment complex in a busy part of my town. From my second-floor balcony, I can see my neighbors coming and going from their jobs, appointments, errands and other activities. While I have glimpses into their everyday lives, I don't really know any of my neighbors on a personal level. The extent of my interactions with my neighbors consists of the polite \"Hello, how are you?\" or \"Have a nice day,\"-type exchanges. Sometimes, I wonder what my neighbors notice about me.I live a rather isolated life, except for occasional visits from my family. I look physically fit, well-groomed and reasonably healthy. While I am noticeably less social, my mental health condition is not outwardly detectable. I often wonder how my neighbors would react if they knew I have schizophrenia.Most people know that mental illness impacts one’s thinking or behavior. However, due to the pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness, people may not know that mental health conditions can be treated (usually with a combination of medication and therapy) — and people living with mental illness can lead normal and joyful lives.I have often thought about what I wish I could communicate to my neighbors. My illness greatly affects my life — just as any physical illness would — but schizophrenia does not define me. If I could tell my neighbors anything about myself, this is what I would share:If my neighbors found out I have schizophrenia, I would want them to know that I am not a danger to them. I would want to explain that the negative portrayals of this condition in the media are misleading and sensationalized; I do not own a gun, I am not wildly unpredictable, and I am certainly not a serial killer, despite what crime dramas may suggest. In fact, research shows that I am more likely to be the victim of a crime than a perpetrator.Ultimately, I understand that the label of my diagnosis can be intimidating for people who are unfamiliar with serious mental illness — but I hope to start a dialogue and explain my situation. I would be happy to share my daily experience, from my symptoms to the medications I take.If my neighbors learned of my diagnosis, I would want them to see the complexities of me as a person. Firstly, that I am not a dangerous criminal— but more than that, I have a productive life as a writer and mental health advocate. I’ve learned and proven that words can be powerful, if used in the right way. I use my voice as an advocate to educate people about the lived experience of serious mental illness. And I am open to having difficult conversations; there is no question about my mental illness that I am afraid to answer, and if I don’t know, I do my best to find the answer.My work goes beyond mental health advocacy. I would also like for my neighbors to know that I am an American patriot; I am a veteran having served my country in the U.S. Army. I love the fact that America is a country of diversity — and much of what makes us a great country is that we appreciate the unique contributions that come from all our citizens. And I have many contributions to offer.While my life may look different from my neighbors’ lives, we have plenty of things in common. From my balcony, I can see some of my neighbors playing sports. I wish they knew that I have always enjoyed physical exercise. Specifically, I love to play basketball, and I would appreciate it if someone asked to play a game of pick-up basketball at the new court near our apartments. I also enjoy working out, and I would like to have a workout buddy when using the fitness center in our apartment complex. Not only is exercise a fun activity, but it also helps me manage my symptoms.Ultimately, I wish my neighbors knew that I have the same emotional needs as anyone else. Although they might not see lots of people coming and going from my apartment, I want them to know that sometimes I like to have company — just someone to hang out with or watch a ballgame with. I have a large collection of vinyl records and would love to show off my jazz collection to them. I also like to cook and would enjoy cooking for other people, not just myself. Maybe a neighbor and I could cook together. The combination of a homemade dinner and good jazz sounds like a wonderful evening to me.Those of us who have mental health diagnoses simply want to be seen for who we are and to feel understood when we experience mental health challenges. We are productive, well-intentioned people who make major contributions to our society every day. Since one in four people are affected by mental illness, it is safe to say that people in every rung of society struggle every day to fight the stigma that isolates us. I believe the solution exists in simply talking to those around us — to find the things we have in common.I would jump at the opportunity to explore some of those commonalities with some of my neighbors.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

      "body": "As I look back on my life, I remember that younger me experienced a roller coaster of emotions — I was either on top of the world or feeling like the world was ending. Growing up as a boy actively involved in sports from a young age, I never witnessed discussions about mental well-being or managing emotions.My focus was on trying to keep up with my older brother and my friends in sports, but somehow, I always felt like I was a little bit behind or “less than” as a person. As I progressed into professional baseball, those feelings stuck with me. Even during my most successful times, it was still hard for me to feel worthy; I felt like I was constantly letting myself, or others, down.The emotional pain and depression became unbearable, and in April 2020, I attempted to take my own life. Waking up in the hospital, one of my first thoughts was, “I survived for a reason. My mission is to help other people, so they never have to get to this point.”Since then, I’ve learned so much about myself, about mental health and about treatments I didn’t even know were available, like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). I don’t claim to be an expert, but if my experience can help even one person, I want to share it.While I grew up prioritizing physical strength and athleticism, I have since learned that there is strength in vulnerability. The courage to ask for help and take control of your struggles is a whole different kind of strength. Understanding this has allowed me to find a level of confidence I was always missing. At first, I was afraid people would see me only as someone with mental illness. That’s all they would expect me to talk about.Somehow, I believed I would lose myself, and mental illness would become my identity. Now, I realize that labels are not important. People still appreciate me for me, and my illness doesn’t define me. It took strength — emotional strength — to work past that fear.Perhaps most importantly, I have learned that getting help early is critical. Don’t wait until you’re in crisis. I wasn’t suicidal until I was, and by then, I couldn’t think clearly or logically anymore. Focusing on your mental health as an empowering, preventative practice instead of as a reactive, crisis response can help you learn about techniques and treatment options to manage your health. Having self-care routines and coping strategies in place would have helped me get through that difficult time before it became unbearable.Now, I have what I call my “trifecta” in addition to my therapy work — which consists of regular exercise, meditation and journaling. In particularly difficult situations, I seek out TMS therapy. This noninvasive procedure, which uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, has been proven to alleviate many symptoms of depression.This is what happens to work for me. What’s important is finding what works best for you. We plan for other things in our life like, physical health and financial well-being — so why not be proactive about mental health?Mental illness can be an isolating experience; often, you may feel like you’re the only one battling this kind of pain. But what I’ve learned on my mental health journey is that you’re never alone, no matter how much it may feel like you are. When you do seek help and voice your discomfort for the first time, you’ll find that there are people and tools ready to support you. These last two and a half years since my attempt to take my life, I’ve pushed myself to be open-minded and committed to getting the help I need. Ultimately, I found that people were incredibly supportive — my family, friends, teammates, doctors and therapists.This encouragement and support allowed me to wholeheartedly pursue recovery. I was even excited to try medication. Although it ultimately wasn’t the right choice for me because of the side effects, I know it is a huge aid and a very important part of the process for many people. Fortunately, my doctor told me about TMS therapy, which was a lifesaving practice. This treatment option allowed me to find more stability and feel hopeful as I continued my mental health journey. I wish I had known about TMS sooner, so I didn’t have to go through as much trial and error with medications.While the process of finding the right treatment plan can be frustrating, discovering what works best for you is lifesaving. Personally, I’ve found I do best with a combination of weekly therapy, daily self-care routines, deeper social connections and giving back by being a mental health advocate.Mental health is something I’m always working on, and it will be a lifelong journey. As I’ve progressed in my recovery, I have come to understand that mental health conditions are treatable and manageable. There are resources available, and my responsibility is to commit to being healthy.If I stick to my treatment plan and celebrate my progress, I have the opportunity to encourage others to get help too. Healing work is empowering, necessary at times and even cool. When I brag about going to therapy, I hope anyone who overhears will feel moved or more comfortable to start their own journey of becoming their best version of themselves. Connecting with people and encouraging them to open up about their feelings and experiences has become my mission. I know first-hand how transformative it can be to take that first step toward finding out that strength isn’t always physical.Drew Robinson is a former Major League Baseball player and current mental health advocate.

      "body": "I’m at a point in my recovery where I feel more comfortable in my thoughts and behaviors. I understand my health and my needs — and I have a more relaxed attitude toward life. But this wasn’t always the case.In 2012, I was struggling. I had lost my mother a year before, and I wasn’t handling the loss well. I needed to be hospitalized and was put under psychiatric evaluation for six months.As I look back on my mental health journey, I often think about the many roadblocks I could have avoided if I had simply known a few basic truths and tips. These are a few truths I learned on my road to recovery.Self-blame is a problem for many of us living with mental illness — I have dealt with it often. This tendency, I learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is a common cognitive distortion — a thought pattern that is often inaccurate and negatively biased.My thought pattern manifested in me blaming myself whenever anything went wrong. Yes, there were things that may have been within my control that had been mismanaged, but most things I blamed myself for— namely, my mental illness and accompanying symptoms — weren’t the same as what I could actually control.Now, I am careful to analyze distressing situations as they arise, determining if the circumstances are something I can control. I have come to understand that I can control my own actions and responses, but I cannot control external events or hold myself responsible for others’ feelings and actions.Throughout my mental health journey, I battled another cognitive distortion: black-and-white thinking. When I would engage in black-and-white thinking, I could only interpret events in extremes; I believed that everyone and everything fell into two different categories, Good and Bad. Thinking this way forced me to divide my world and miss out on the nuances of life and the complexities of people. &I saw everyone as either a “good guy” or “bad guy” — and in the depths of my mental illness, I could only see certain people as the enemy. This often put me in a victim mindset, and I would make decisions and act out of fear and perceived danger. Thankfully my time spent in therapy has broken down that barrier and has allowed me to see that in the end, people are just people, and not everything is good or bad.Perhaps the most important lesson I learned is that treatment can be most effective when it is a collaborative process. You and your mental health professionals are a team. At the beginning of my journey, I simply took the medication that was given to me by my medical providers. I was never an active participant in my treatment.I never spoke up about negative side effects of medications or articulated my goals for recovery. As a result, I didn’t see the outcomes I wanted, so I would stop taking my medication. Slowly, my condition would deteriorate even further. I often lied to my doctors and told them I was taking the medication, rather than admitting that the side effects had become too much to handle. I seemed outwardly compliant, but I was harming myself by not voicing my concerns.Once I started to be honest with my doctor, we adjusted my medication to find a better fit. This, combined with regular therapy got me closer to the current point in my recovery. I wish I could tell my younger self that she could speak up at any time, ask questions and advocate for herself. Always remember: You are the priority in your own treatment.I believe that there is dignity in working and accomplishing tasks. And, like most of us, I was raised in a culture that valued hard work and success. But I have also learned that managing my energy — when I have too much or too little — is a critical part of my recovery. Self-care and productivity, I’ve learned, can coexist in a healthy balance.To find this balance, I had to recognize that I had a bad habit of tying my productivity and my accomplishments to my self-worth. When I would have a busy or productive day, I felt more “useful” and considered myself “good”— somehow superior to the person I was on the days when I didn’t do anything. However, the height of my “productivity” occurred during my manic episodes — it was never focused or sustainable.Now, I understand that I am not “better” when I am manic. I am better when I allow myself to rest and find consistent, healthy habits.I love the arts. Drawing and painting were always my favorite classes in high school. There’s something magical about creating art — and it has always helped me to limit my symptoms. The process of creating art has also alleviated much of my social anxiety — a phenomenon that is backed by research. Early on in my mental health journey, I remember that I first found relief in art therapy groups. Even on my darker days, art provided a bright spot.Now, I try to work art projects into my self-care routine. I schedule at least an hour each week for creating. My work doesn’t have to be perfect — no painting ever is. It simply needs to fill me with joy, excitement and gratitude.Since receiving my first diagnosis, I have made leaps and bounds in my self-awareness and recovery. The people I have met, and the changes I have made to my life, have allowed me to be a more caring, informed and well-rounded individual. Through therapy and self-care, I have become a person empowered to make her own choices in life.Cindy Tillory is a mental health advocate and peer support specialist in sunny, southern California.

      "body": "I arrived at the psychiatric hospital in June of 2019. I had struggled for years with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and they both worsened after having my two kids. Leading up to the hospitalization, I had been abusing my anxiety medication (a benzodiazepine) and struggling with compulsive behaviors, like shopping, cutting and binge eating.That first day, I wore a long, blue and white dress with a sash around my waist, which was dressy for me. I was hopeful. I figured I would be there for just a couple of weeks, and then I would be cured. Maybe that’s how hospitalization works for some people, but it did not go that way for me. And for many people living with serious mental illness (SMI), the journey to recovery is not that simple.Looking back on my history, I hope to share the lessons I learned along the way.That morning, after kissing my husband goodbye, a member of the hospital staff took the sash from my dress. I was not allowed any item that could be used for self-harm. I was taken to my room, which looked like a dorm room, but there was no shower door, just a curtain (also a safety precaution). During the day, a staff member would come by and check on us every 15 minutes. At night, too. These extreme measures opened my eyes to how dire my situation was.My work to create an effective and sustainable treatment plan — one that would carry me through my outpatient healing — began immediately. I was given a busy schedule of classes on how to cope with difficult emotions, how to communicate about my illnesses and how to be mindful. When I didn’t have class, I met with a team of doctors and staff — social workers, therapists, a psychologist and psychiatrist. They told me I could not be discharged until we finished and approved my treatment plan. I also did a battery of psychiatric tests, growing my list of diagnoses: dysthymia, avoidant personality disorder, along with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.After doctors determined I had treatment-resistant depression (meaning that some medications would not work for me) we opted to try electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). That also was a big wake-up call: I was very sick. That’s when I first understood that I would be walking a tight rope when it came to my recovery. I couldn’t be cured, but I could manage my symptoms and find my balance.After six weeks in treatment, I felt like I’d made significant progress and was ready to head home to see my family. But looking back, I wish I had stayed at the hospital longer, soaking up all the classes and advice I could.When I left inpatient treatment, doctors recommended that I continue ECT treatments, go to weekly therapy and refer to my treatment plan, which outlined ways to cope at home.At first, I relied heavily on ECT to work its “magic.” I would take my medication and go to therapy, but any sign of a bad mood left me wanting more ECT. I was going for a treatment every four to six weeks in a city two hours away. Eventually, I learned that even ECT can’t fix everything. My therapist once told me that I couldn’t get ECT every time I had a bad day. And she was right. I had to do the work, and it was hard. I struggled to sit with uncomfortable emotions.I still turned to my binge eating and compulsive shopping for comfort, racking up thousands of dollars on my credit card each month. I didn’t mean to, but this was a behavior that had served me in the past. I needed to learn how to acknowledge my feelings and tolerate distress in a healthy way.That’s one thing I’ve learned about recovery: It’s all a balancing act. And, as my compulsive behaviors spiraled, I didn’t know if my family could take another fall. Or if there would even be a net to catch me this time.I often feel resentful of my own brain; it seems like a betrayal that I have to walk the line so carefully when others don’t. And sometimes, I wonder if I I’ll ever go a day without thinking about my mental health. Even four years after my hospital stay, my recovery is a constant effort. I’m still learning that not all coping mechanisms are healthy and that slip ups and setbacks are common. I’m learning that medication can fail and even if I follow all the “rules,” I can still find myself in a depressive episode.However, I find comfort in knowing I am not alone. In 2020, an estimated 14.2 million adults in the U.S. dealt with a serious mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). And many of us who make up this statistic find the right kind of help and successfully manage our symptoms.When I get discouraged about my mental health, I like to think about the progress I’ve made — I’m miles away from where I was that day in my blue and white dress.For a long time, I blamed myself for my illness, and I shouldered the heavy burden of other people’s opinions about me and my mental health. However, through treatment and reflection, I have come to understand that my illness is not my fault.Reaching this realization has allowed me to find my voice. After I left the hospital, I started blogging about my experience. I told the truth about everything (suicidal thoughts, diagnoses, etc.). I told readers my deepest darkest secrets, and it was so freeing. I no longer feel shame or any stigma associated with having a mental illness. So many people have reached out to me since 2019, saying they feel the same way but can’t talk about it with loved ones yet. I get that, and I’m happy to lend my voice to others’ struggles if it means they don’t feel so alone, like I did years ago.Even with all this progress, it’s still hard — and that’s ok. Every day I get a little stronger, and I grow. That’s all I can ask of myself.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

I envisioned Hallmark-style Mother’s Days filled with cards, flowers and breakfast in bed. But over the years, that dream vanished. And one Mother’s Day, I found myself in the hospital’s psychiatric unit, praying my 17-year-old son, Nick, would live. He thought the solution to his pain was making an attempt on his life, and I was heartbroken.Before this incident, my attention had been on my 15-year-old daughter, Katie, who has a reactive attachment disorder, autism, bipolar disorder and several other diagnoses. These issues required much of my time and energy, and her problems were multilayered. Doctors disagreed on the diagnosis, and we didn’t receive the necessary social-emotional support from the school system. Ultimately, I didn’t really care about the cause of Katie’s struggles; I just longed for a solution that would allow her to live peacefully and independently, without being placed on frequent psychiatric holds.With Nick, I never saw it coming. I was barely keeping my head above water in dealing with Katie’s issues. When he was withdrawn and irritable, I chalked it up to teenage angst and never considered my handsome surfer son, with all the potential in the world, needed help. Nothing could describe my brokenness as I realized that not just one, but both children were struggling with their mental health.As a perfectionist, I beat myself up for not knowing. The signs of depression and anxiety didn’t appear in “What to Expect When Your Expecting” or the other parenting books I read in my attempt to raise my children. No one in my family suffered from mental health issues, and I didn’t hear any conversation about it in the parenting or school community.In the months before Nick’s suicide attempt, our relationship had deteriorated. He’d said I was a bad mother; evidently, I had never loved and cared for him. I was selfish and self-centered. I lived in a world of white picket fences where everything had to be perfect. So, on that Mother’s Day, while I sat by my son’s hospital bed, I wished I could resign. The position of mother had become a badge of shame.I came to realize something painful. Over the years, I had done an excellent job of maintaining a perfect façade. On the outside, things looked good. I was professionally accomplished. My house was clean and organized. My kids were bathed and fed. And I didn’t look like a mess. But I was a complete disaster on the inside. My marriage had deteriorated, my daughter had severe issues and my son had just attempted suicide. The façade shattered — but ultimately, that was a blessing. In the rebuilding of my life, I learned a few lessons:Over the years, I sought therapy, which provided some relief. But I never knew where to turn for peer support. Few people understood what I was going through with my daughter because she was so unique, as she navigated her emotions surrounding her diagnoses and her adoption. She didn’t fit neatly into most support group categories, and few people, even medical professionals, understood reactive attachment disorder.Eventually, I found a weekly support group for parents of teens through our mental wellness center. It was a lifesaver to share my unpredictable and imperfect life in a safe place without judgment. Years later, I learned about NAMI’s Family-to-Family course and the amazing resources available to parents and loved ones.One thing I was surprised to learn was that managing mental illness is like dealing with any other medical condition: it is part art and part science. Having been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 10, I am intimately familiar with the need to constantly monitor multiple factors for a successful day. I can do everything perfectly and my body can decide not to cooperate — causing my blood sugars to skyrocket or plummet — both of which are dangerous.When mental illness first showed up in our family, I thought that by taking a pill, everything would go back to “normal.” But I was wrong. While medication has its place — working for one person but not another — there are so many other factors that contribute to having a good day.For example, both my children do better when they eat well, exercise, don’t isolate and get enough sleep (but not too much). My daughter does better with medication, and my son does not. But there isn’t a perfect formula for either of their well-being, just like there isn’t for my diabetes. And this was something I had to experience to understand.Recognizing that I couldn’t resign from motherhood, I opened myself up to taking a different approach. I learned to be nicer to myself and to stop the negative self-talk. I examined my role in our family to understand how to do better in the future, and I educated myself on mental health — both mine and my kids. And I’m so grateful I did.Through self-care, therapy, journaling, prayer, support groups and 12-step recovery meetings, I went from surviving to thriving. I grew and found healing. If I hadn’t gone through those traumatic experiences, I wouldn’t be the person I am today, which sounds so simplistic. But the message is important: If my life had gone according to my script, I wouldn’t have this wonderfully imperfect life, living with joy despite the hardships.Valerie Cantella is passionate about helping others who have a loved one with mental health and substance abuse issues.

      "body": "In the 20 years I have lived with mental illness, I have learned some critical lessons — mostly the hard way.As I reflect on my past, I want to share what I have learned to help people like me reach recovery (hopefully, more easily and quickly than I did).Below are some key lessons. I wish I had known them much earlier on in my journey.My recovery required me to have compassion for myself. Indeed, my healing was rooted in the following principles:With these in mind, you can better practice self-care and forgiveness.Being diagnosed with a mental health condition or experiencing severe symptoms of a mental illness can feel all-consuming. But you will always be more than a diagnosis or a label.As you navigate a diagnosis and treatment, please remember the following:There is no cure for mental health conditions, particularly serious mental illness (SMI), but you can manage symptoms, and you can live a fulfilling life — the key is to get help early. Delaying treatment can make a condition worse and harder to treat, so it’s essential not to diminish or dismiss symptoms, or assume they’ll eventually go away.Empower yourself by learning about your illness and treatment options from reputable sources (practitioners, academic research, NAMI, etc.). Spend time researching and finding a good psychiatrist with experience treating your condition. Then, work with them to come up with a plan that works for you and your diagnosis. Be an active participant in your care and have open discussions with your provider about any concerns (side effects, for example).Be patient and keep in mind that treatment can take time to work. Do not change medication dosages on your own if you feel a medication is not working, as that can lead to relapse.Don’t fear, but be prepared for, a crisis. If you have a plan in place, you will have more control in the event of a mental health crisis. Ultimately, treatment can be a difficult process, but knowledge and self-awareness can help carry you though to recovery.Recovery can often feel like an unreachable place but remembering the following principles can give you strength.While it can be difficult to shift your perspective, doing so can create more opportunities for recovery.When living with mental illness, relationships and social connections can be difficult to forge and maintain. But the following lessons have allowed me to have healthy and supportive relationships:Healing requires acknowledging and surviving the stigma surrounding mental illness. Stigma is ignorance. It is the problem of those who perpetuate it, not yours. You don’t have to internalize it. There are too many tragedies in our community due to stigma, but there are also beautiful stories of recovery and progress, too. If you feel comfortable, speaking out against stigma will pave the way for self-empowerment and for others to find recovery.Over the course of your mental health journey, there will always be more to learn. But embrace what you have learned; chances are, you recognized many of these lessons in your own journey. But living by them is a conscious choice, every day. Prioritizing these steps can allow for huge strides in recovery. Perhaps you can even reach recovery more easily than I did.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "Living with any chronic illness isn’t easy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is no exception.Some days, my thought patterns are easy to manage, and some days, the OCD wins — hands down. Indeed, my low points have included two major crises where I had to take significant time off work because I was so ill. But the high points include learning self-care, impermanence and resilience, and gaining an amazing community.I’ve had OCD for 27 years. That’s more than a quarter of a century. I figure passing 25 years makes this a good a time to look back at how my mental health journey started and what I’ve gained along the way.I first showed signs of OCD in middle school, though neither my family nor I realized it. I went through a period where I washed my hands all. the. time. I washed them so much that they were dry, cracked, raw and bleeding. I didn’t know why I was doing this, but I couldn’t stop. I was ashamed and didn’t talk to anyone about it because I was so embarrassed.Toward the end of high school, I developed “checking rituals.” Before going to bed every night, I had to make sure all the doors and windows were locked; otherwise, I believed, someone might break in and hurt my family. I also had to ensure that everything was plugged in properly; otherwise the house might catch fire while we were asleep. In my mind, the consequences of not checking were deadly, so I’d check the locks and plugs two, three, four, five times — as many times as it took before I could finally convince my brain we were safe. It was exhausting.It wasn’t until my junior year of college that I went from having some symptoms to full-blown OCD.I was moving into my dorm room, which had a shared bathroom, and the shower didn’t drain. I bought some Drano, poured it down the drain and thought, “There! Problem solved.” Later, my suitemate told me that she had contacted the maintenance department, who used another drain cleaner and told us it was very important not to use anything else. I started panicking.What if the two drain cleaners mix? I wondered. They can produce harmful gases. And the gases might be odorless. My room could be filling up with deadly odorless gas and I wouldn’t even know.I emailed maintenance, and they emailed back, telling me not to worry, that it would be ok. But their reassurance didn’t help. While I knew, logically, that the experts were right, I was still terrified, but didn’t know what else to do. I climbed into bed that night truly believing that I wasn’t going to wake up in the morning.I had more and more incidents over the next four months, and I became increasingly anxious and exhausted. By the end of that semester, I was so anxious I literally couldn’t sit still or focus on studying for my exams.You need to study for your exam tomorrow? I would tell myself. That’s nice. How about you take the bus to the store to buy cleaning products you don’t need because you can’t stop obsessing about the thing that might maybe potentially one day kill you if you don’t take care of it RIGHT NOW.Finally, with my roommate’s help, I went to the school counseling center, got my exams deferred and went home to start working on my mental health.As a young adult, I was a bit careless with my self-care. Stay up ‘til 2 am? Sure! Hydrate with Mountain Dew? Bring it on! I learned, though, that while these behaviors felt great in the moment, it felt even better when I adjusted my habits so that my OCD wasn’t completely overwhelming; over many years, I learned to set a regular bedtime, to remember to eat, to drink water, to take on less work, to take time to rest, and so forth. OCD forced me to develop habits that, ultimately, make a positive impact on all parts of my life.I also learned to change my relationship with OCD. While I certainly had (and have) every right to be frustrated and irritated when I’ve driven myself to exhaustion because I need to clean the whole house right now, being frustrated and irritated didn’t make me feel better any faster.Now, I’m much better (though definitely not perfect) at adopting the following perspective: “Ok, you don’t feel well and are frustrated. This isn’t permanent. What self-care can you do while you’re riding this out? What can you let go and pick back up when you’re well again?” Understanding impermanence and practicing this kind of resilience are incredibly helpful tools, so I’m glad having OCD gave me the opportunity to learn them.OCD is what led me to finding my community. I can’t tell you how wonderful it was the first time I attended a NAMI program in 2011. I didn’t have to explain myself, or my emotions, or what XYZ meant; everyone else in that room had been through similar experiences.It was in that first NAMI program, too, where I realized I’d learned a lot about mental health conditions and that I could help others. That first program was NAMI Family-to-Family, and I was able to connect as both a family member and share some perspective about having a mental health condition myself.I’m now trained as a NAMI Family-to-Family program leader, NAMI In Our Own Voice program leader, NAMI Ending the Silence program leader and NAMI Peer-to-Peer program leader and trainer. I’ve met amazing and wonderful people volunteering with NAMI over the years, and I am truly thankful that I can give back in this way. That feeling of coming home, of knowing that NAMI people are my people, is amazing every time.I’ve often wished I didn’t have OCD, particularly when I’ve been feeling low and struggling. That said, if I had the chance to re-do the last 27 years without OCD, I wouldn’t. I’m not defined by my OCD, but it has greatly influenced my life.OCD isn’t fun, but I wouldn’t be who I am without it, and I turned out to be pretty awesome. Weird, but awesome. I hope that 27 years down the line, I’ve continued to use my experiences with OCD — good and bad — to help me stay healthy, enjoy life and help the community I’m so glad to be part of.Liz Norton is the Director of Business Analysis at NAMI.Note: This article was originally published in the Spring 2022 Issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Schizoaffective disorder — a disorder that is a combination of schizophrenia and, in my case, major depression — is a big part of my life. I find that often, my symptoms dictate what I am able to do in my daily life. Fortunately, I have developed certain coping mechanisms that make the days easier and allow me to find some reprieve from my illness.My hope is that if you struggle with schizophrenia yourself, the following coping mechanisms might give you some relief from your illness as well.One of the best steps I have taken to improve my mental health is to get an emotional support animal, a cat named Fat Louie. Owning a cat has some strictly practical benefits; having a living creature around helps me understand whether the hallucinations I experience are real or not. If Fat Louie acts like he can see what I am seeing, then I know can know that it is real. And if he doesn’t, this can be a strong indicator that I am experiencing hallucinations.Equally importantly, he helps to comfort me when I am experiencing major depressive episodes. When I am struggling, I have the joy of experiencing complete and unlimited love. Without Louie, daily struggles would feel almost insurmountable. I fully understand that Fat Louie has been a lifesaver in helping me live a manageable life — and I hope animals can bring a similar comfort to others.This coping mechanism might come off as simplistic, but I’ve learned that even the smallest tasks can be lifesaving. I have a collection of different “fidget putties” and dough that help ground me when I am hallucinating. When I am hallucinating, I often feel like I am floating or that I am not completely in my body. But when I have some putty or dough to fidget with, I feel more securely rooted in my body, and I am able to stay present and grounded. Using putty and dough also help me when I am experiencing intense anxiety, as the use of my hands allows me to direct my energy toward a specific task.Like the putty and dough, having a heating pad helps when my hallucinations become irritating or debilitating. Often, my hallucinations — and resulting frustration — interrupt my ability to stay present and evaluate my reality. Heating pads (or warming stuffed animals) with lavender bring me a sense of comfort and stabilization that allow me to function on tough days.This coping mechanism, while seemingly contradictory to the coping mechanism above, can be just as helpful. When I am experiencing strong hallucinations and severe anxiety, almost nothing can relieve me from the distress; however, dunking my face in a bowl of cold water helps to “zap” me out of what I am experiencing. The introduction of an extreme temperature allows me to reset and pay attention to what is happening in my body. In times of severe distress, I typically need strong measures, and this particular coping mechanism has helped me on many occasions.I experience auditory hallucinations that cause me a lot of irritation and distress, but I have found that watching comforting shows or listening to music that I enjoy often helps to bring me some relief when I am having an episode. I also discovered that focusing on the plot of a show and the feeling of the music can help to drown out the voices and grounding me in reality.Schizophrenia is a severe — and often debilitating — mental illness, but I have discovered small actions that can aid me through many of my episodes. My hope is that learning more about my coping mechanisms will help people without a mental illness to understand schizophrenia from a lived experience perspective. But more importantly, I hope that my experience will provide people living with schizophrenia with tools to help them cope. Living with this illness can often be difficult, but there are ways to manage the symptoms and live a joyful life.Ashley Nestler, MSW is a survivor of multiple mental illnesses.

      "body": "I am the parent of an adult child with serious mental health challenges. Over the last decade, since the onset of symptoms and multiple failed attempts at an accurate “diagnosis,” our family has learned a lot about teamwork, self-care, support and acceptance — none of which we knew at the outset of our journey.This is what I’ve learned about family involvement in a loved one’s healing and recovery.1. Know Your Involvement Can Improve OutcomesAs a family member, you can be a reliable source to provide accurate family and clinical history to your loved one’s clinical team. Your hands-on experience is key to offering timely relevant clinical updates — you know your child, parent or sibling better than anyone else. In addition, you can play a vital role as an advocate within the applicable health and legal systems. Your loved one will benefit if you are able to “quarterback” the team, selecting and coordinating the labyrinth of available resources.2. Prepare for a Marathon, Not a SprintI was reminded early on by one of our clinicians to “prepare for a marathon; not a sprint.”Whenever things got tough, I would repeat the mantra “take the long view.” This has been invaluable because mental health recovery is not linear; it’s a roller coaster ride. But it has gotten easier with time. Learning to manage your energy levels around this emotionally and physically draining work requires a lot of self-care, especially given the fact that you are not in control of the timing of symptoms.I leaned into rituals and practices for my own well-being and aimed to nourish myself and replenish my own needs. I focused on gratitude, especially when things were going well. I have found it helpful to celebrate every victory along the way, skipping over nothing, no matter how small.Finally, it’s important to manage your financial resources accordingly by preserving as much capital as possible with each choice, as your expenses will likely be lifelong.3. Build a Village of SupportAt the outset, it’s important to begin building an “A” team of outpatient professionals who will be your “village.” These are people who will support you as well as your family member. You will benefit from multiple layers of support in more ways than you can imagine.As you build your team, note that not all care is equal. There is tremendous variability among quality and types of care depending on your personal resources, access to providers and the state and community where you live. Beware of internet marketing for treatment programs that claim they will solve all your problems. It’s not that simple. To pay for all this, you will need to become an expert at navigating the complex and frustrating maze of health insurance.Here’s a list of providers you will want to know about:4. Practice Radical AcceptanceOne of the most emotionally challenging, yet important, pieces is learning to reframe your expectations of what your child may have been to who your child is. You may witness your child going from a near-death experience to showing their unique and special purpose on the planet, and sometimes more than once.You may experience stages of grief as you navigate your loved one’s mental health journey, as you will likely experience what is known as an “ambiguous loss.” This occurs when the person is still alive in physical form, but not the person they used to be (this is also common with conditions like Alzheimer’s and dementia, among others).When you can meet them where they are, not where you had hoped they would be, it helps with both connection and hopefulness. I’ve learned that my own acceptance of “what is” is one of the most important parts of my happiness and of my relationship with my loved one. When I am in the present moment, focusing on where they are right now, not where I had perhaps hoped they would be, I am grateful.Enjoying my connection with them and appreciating their gifts and insights brings me hope.5. Surround Yourself with Supportive and Empathetic FriendsYour life experiences may be radically different from those of most of your friends. As such, you may notice that friendships change; some old ones will go, and new ones will enter. It’s helpful appreciate how difficult it may be for your old friends to understand how different your experience is from theirs.My own experience is that some people become so uncomfortable that they stop asking about your family member, so as not to “upset you,” not understanding that it’s actually they who are upset, and you who would appreciate the listening ear!It's important to set healthy boundaries to preserve your capacity around friends. Become masterful at saying “no.” Avoid over-committing, even if it felt good at one point in your life, as things are different now. Finally, I recommend reducing social media exposure as it can feel triggering to see what others are posting when you and your loved ones are struggling.6. Remain person-centricYour loved one needs to learn through trial and error how to manage their own mental health as this is the only thing that will be sustainable in the long run. To assist, it’s important for you to use recovery-oriented language, such as “mental or behavioral health” challenge vs. “mental illness.” Practice reframing your thinking from the model of “illness” to “different or non-neurotypical thinking,” so as to remove judgement, help decrease stigma and to expand possibilities for you and for them.7. Be Open to Exploring Outside the Standard Medical ModelMy own bias was that the model of “medication first” was the only approach to stabilize severe symptoms. And medication is important. However, in the longer term, people with mental health challenges will benefit immensely from a comprehensive system of well-being, including: trusting relationships with family and a close circle of friends; an experienced therapist and psychiatrist; proper nutrition for their physical constitution; regular exercise; and meditation, breathing exercises and other calming, restorative practices.Finally, I invite you to trust the process of life — the right people and possibilities will show up when needed. What is possible may be different and greater than anything you imagined.Susan S.

      "body": "I have bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that has shaped my career, my relationships and even my sense of self. Yet, until recently, I treated this part of my life as a shameful secret to be hidden at all costs. The negative stereotypes surrounding bipolar disorder, combined with some hurtful personal experiences when sharing my experience, made me terrified to reveal my diagnosis. Even many close friends and family members did not know.What I later realized, however, was the cost of keeping this secret. By hiding my diagnosis, I was placing a heavy burden on myself — depriving myself of the chance to be in control of my personal story — one that I eventually decided to lift. I would be lying if I said that sharing my diagnosis is never awkward or frightening, but this is only half the picture. What I never expected was how empowering sharing my diagnosis would be.Last October, I faced a difficult turning point in my mental health journey. I had a manic episode, and during the height of mania, I sent nonsensical emails to my graduate student peers. I often suffer memory loss during episodes, but I know that the emails focused on “magic spells” and a belief that someone was trying to hurt me.Some of my peers found my emails frightening and expressed concern for their personal safety. When I heard this, I was dumbstruck. Even amid my mania, I was shocked to realize that people might be afraid of me. To be clear, I blame negative media portrayals of mental illness and not my peers for this reaction. As a psychologist, I know that humans make inferences about the world based on what we see. And what we see in books, movies, and TV shows is mental illness paired with violence and chaos.When the episode was over, I made the decision to stop hiding. My peers’ reaction helped me see that people need exposure to mental illness. People are often afraid of things they do not understand. I wanted to facilitate change by educating my peers. Additionally, I realized that telling my story allows me to control the narrative, rather than allowing gossip and secondhand information to take shape.So, I wrote an email to my peers explaining that I have bipolar disorder and included educational information on psychosis. Hitting “send” on that email was excruciating, but luckily, my peers responded positively. One even thanked me. Although I wish this incident had not taken place at all, I am grateful for the personal growth it inspired. Since then, I have become more open about my mental health and have even sought out opportunities to share my experiences with others.The more I tell my story, the more I realize that disclosing one’s mental illness is an art, not a science. “Coming out” is a never-ending process, not a one-time grand event. I’ve learned that you do not have to tell everything to everyone. For example, I can disclose my diagnosis but keep private details, such as the medications I take and my medical history, to myself. Or I might share intimate details with one person and the bare minimum with another. Realizing I could make these distinctions has been liberating and made the disclosure process easier. Now, when symptoms arise, it feels incredibly freeing to simply tell the truth rather than make up yet another excuse for canceled plans or odd behavior.I don’t have all the answers, nor do I want to pressure anyone to talk about their mental health. But I strongly believe that mental illness will never be destigmatized until more people speak openly about it, and I want to lead by example. I have always loved the words of Marianne Williamson: “And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”When we share our stories, we inadvertently give others permission to do the same. Uttering the words, “I have a mental illness,” brings to light something that was previously shrouded in secrecy and darkness, and that is a powerful act.Ashley Ransom completed her Ph.D. in developmental psychology at Cornell University and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

      "body": "When considering different types of treatment for mental health, therapy may be the option that first comes to mind. As the national conversation about mental health has evolved, pursuing therapy has become more and more common — and people are challenging the stigma that surrounds seeking treatment. Indeed, it often seems as though most people have been in therapy at some point in their lives. When making a decision about mental health treatment, it’s important to know that there are different types of therapy to try.Looking back, I wish I had known about two specific types of therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT).CBT, as defined by the Mayo clinic, is a type of talk therapy that “helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.” In simpler terms, CBT is a form of therapy that helps a person reframe their thoughts brought on by mental illness.As someone who has been in therapy since I was nine years old, I have encountered many different therapeutic techniques, and CBT has worked wonders for me. I was able to use CBT’s three main practices — thought-reframing, acknowledgement/awareness and relaxation/meditation — to navigate my negative thoughts in the throes of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder and more. This method allowed me to sit down and verbalize the issues I was struggling with, which made them feel more “real.” This, in turn, made my negative thoughts easier to tackle. If you’re interested in pursuing CBT, it’s important to learn about its core components.Even though this may take time, thought reframing can be one of the most effective tactics in CBT. For example, if you feel like you are losing control of something in your life, thought reframing would require you to evaluate the situation, determine what you do have control of in your life and focus on taking the necessary steps to address the thing you can control. This technique does take practice but can be very beneficial once mastered. In my experience using this technique, I have been able to look at a specific struggle, such as a fear of abandonment, and remind myself of the people who have been there for me and what positivity they bring to my life.Perhaps when you hear the phrase “acknowledging your feelings,” you may think of “throwing a pity party.” This technique is, in fact, the opposite. Becoming aware and recognizing what you’re feeling are critical steps in overcoming counterproductive thinking. Without fully identifying what you’re feeling, there’s no way to pinpoint what you should be doing to counteract them. For example, when something makes me angry, I don’t tell myself I’m being irrational for feeling that way. Instead, I let myself momentarily feel angry before taking positive steps to combat negative actions that may pop up from that feeling.When you think of meditation, perhaps you picture deep breathing exercises. Although that is an important piece of meditation practice, breathing is not the only technique to practice. Relaxation and meditation can consist of other practices like sensory focus, mind cleansing and cognitive introspection.Sensory focus may be one of the quickest ways to ground yourself. If you’re feeling yourself get to a negative place, looking around you and listing the things you see or hear can bring you back to a more positive headspace. This has been the most helpful tactic for me when I’m in public and start to get overwhelmed. Mind cleansing requires you to let go of negative thoughts that you may hear on repeat in your brain. Cognitive introspection is reflecting on the coping mechanisms you use to handle (or avoid) a situation. Although this technique may be challenging and uncomfortable, identifying negative behaviors and reactions may be exactly what you need to move forward in a more positive way.DBT, a skills-based therapy technique, helps people tolerate and regulate their emotions. It is based on cognitive behavioral principles and focuses on “problem solving and acceptance.”As defined, DBT is under the “umbrella” of CBT, but it works more with problem-solving than thought reframing. Because DBT is driven by problem-solving, many of the activities done in this type of counseling are more physically hands-on than CBT. I also used DBT in therapy sessions throughout the years which helped tremendously with dealing with my bipolar swings. Having more hands-on techniques to practice has given me things to do instead of living in a negative headspace during my mania and depression.Typical DBT activities and tactics may include the following:Just about any therapist or counselor can vouch for the importance of writing down your thoughts and feelings. However, that’s not the only way to journal when it comes to DBT. Making lists, releasing thoughts without fear of judgment and writing down personal goals are all ways to journal effectively. If you’re new to therapy or are seeing someone new, it can be especially hard to fully express your feelings out loud.In writing these things down in a journal, you’re still getting those feelings out in a way that is personal to just you. From there, reading your journal to a counselor may be a good transition into being more candid with your feelings.To practice tolerating negative feelings, DBT often encourages using worksheets (many of which are available online) to walk you through the process. You’ll find many practices including opposite emotion thinking, distress tolerance, emotion regulation practices, personal reflections and more.Opposite emotion thinking is using radically opposite thought processes. For example, if you’re feeling like you need to isolate yourself, go out and do something to get out of the house. Distress tolerance has to do with your reaction to a stressful or distressing situation. A practical way to put that into practice would be to cool yourself down if you feel yourself get physically warm from a triggering situation. In doing that, you’re handling your future reactions by dealing with your current emotional needs. For emotion regulation, a mental check-in can be a beneficial practice to quickly get in touch with what you’re feeling. This can also be done for personal reflections, as well. Most often, these types of practices are done in a group therapy setting, but you can also do them by yourself.Using your senses for your mental health recovery can be extremely effective. Taking note of what you’re sensing can help you achieve more personal awareness and help with grounding techniques, which are most commonly used for anxiety. Using your senses — sight, sound, smell, taste and touch — keeps your focus on what’s physically around you at that moment, not what’s going on in your brain. Sensory practices can be done anywhere and anytime, making it one of the easiest things to do if you can’t access other DBT things. These techniques can also apply to mindfulness in the way that individuals are able to be more aware of thoughts, feelings and surroundings to help ground emotions.Of course, CBT and DBT are not the only types of therapy out there — and they aren’t cure-alls for every mental illness. Also, therapy isn’t the only thing that helps in your mental health recovery (medication and peer support, among other things, are helpful). However, by incorporating therapy into your recovery journey, you might that you make strides toward healthier thinking and emotional well-being.Emmie Pombo is an author, beauty writer and mental health advocate from Nashville, TN.

      "body": "Taking an antipsychotic medication can be a painful and difficult decision, mostly because of the stigma surrounding serious mental illness (SMI), psychosis and the medications themselves. When I first began taking an antipsychotic, I struggled to accept my situation. Ultimately, the fear of taking a stigmatized drug impacted my course of treatment and overall health outcome. I fell into powerful traps and pitfalls that are common among patients with SMI who take antipsychotic medications.I wish I had known then what I understand now. So, let’s debunk these common myths that hinder treatment and positive health outcomes.As I began my journey with treatment, I believed that not taking an antipsychotic meant that I didn’t actually have a mental illness. In other words, I am only sick if I take this medicine. The truth is, refusing to take the medicine obviously will not make the symptoms of any illness go away.We don’t think this way about medications for any other illnesses. For example, when you have heart disease, you would never reason that, “If I don’t take this heart medicine, then I don’t have heart disease,” because, obviously, that doesn’t make sense. In fact, this line of thinking would be life-threatening.Yet, many of us who could benefit from taking antipsychotic medication resist our treatment plans; after all, stigma tells us that we can “fix” ourselves on our own terms. And if we can fix ourselves without antipsychotics, then there was nothing really wrong or flawed about us after all.When I was first prescribed medication, I thought my life (particularly my social and professional life) would be over if I took an antipsychotic. I complied with treatment for many years, but I was hard on myself and lived in fear of anyone finding out about my “big secret.” I constantly judged myself for taking such a powerful medication, and I ended up going off of it prematurely solely due to self-stigma. This, naturally, led to an avoidable relapse.I also firmly believed taking an antipsychotic would keep me from being in a romantic relationship; I worried that I would face rejection as soon as anyone found out about my medication.I knew how my treatment might be perceived; the pervasive stigma made antipsychotics sound like a threat or a judgment, rather than a positive, lifesaving answer. But the reality is that I could not start that a relationship until I took an antipsychotic and prioritized my treatment.The medication saved my life and, in fact, provided a foundation for the future and the relationship I had always wanted. While disclosing my history and medication regimen to my partner was scary, it ended up being an important and necessary passage to build a trusting and supportive relationship.What I now know, in hindsight, is this: my life is only over if I don’t take an antipsychotic.Receiving a stigmatized diagnosis can be intimidating and painful — I’ve been there. Receiving a diagnosis like schizophrenia can feel isolating. So, naturally, many people hope to avoid receiving the label at all. I, like many people, avoided treatment because I wanted to avoid facing the issue altogether; accepting treatment means acknowledging an illness and preparing to weather the social stigma.I know that some people hesitate to see a psychiatrist because taking an antipsychotic medication seems like just one more step toward social condemnation. The fact is, you can’t change your reality by refusing to address it. If you suffer from heart disease and have a heart attack, you would immediately seek medication to prevent another crisis. Psychosis is no different than a physical ailment — the only way forward is to treat the symptoms.The inaccurate and unhealthy messages we receive about mental illness change our perception of treatment. Accordingly, many of us see an antipsychotic as something more than a medicine for medical condition — it is a confirmation or proof that there is something wrong with us as human beings. We have internalized stigma to the point that we believe that needing this form of treatment is a moral failing.The stigma also changes the perceptions of others; people often receive the message that they should be wary of anyone taking an antipsychotic; they may be unreliable and even dangerous. Because some people believe that taking an antipsychotic is proof of a “red flag,” it is easy to view your illness through the perception of others.Only when you choose to look at your illness through your own perspective and sense of compassion for yourself can you act logically, making decisions based on what you know is right for you.I have been stable for a decade while taking a maintenance dose of an antipsychotic each day. In this decade, I have gotten married, have had a child, have developed a career and thrived. The truth is that the rest of my life could not begin until I accepted and consistently took my antipsychotic medication. And I learned what works best for me — I will be taking this medication indefinitely.My medicine is no longer a secret to the people in my life, and now, taking an antipsychotic is no different than taking my contacts out every night. It is my safety net to ensure that I don’t have to suffer through psychosis again, and I will just continue to move forward in my life with this wonderful existence I have cultivated for myself. I once chose to see my illness through other people’s perceptions instead of my own. But now I know better.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "I am not “normal,” although, at one time, I wished for nothing more. At 50 years of age, I am currently a grossly under-employed husband and father, proudly watching my two sons surpass me. The reasons for my current situation are plentiful, but at the root is my path through mental illness — and a continuing evolution toward recovery. I like to joke that I am a diagnostic alphabet soup: ADHD, PTSD, depression, anxiety. Take your pick, I have them all.Since first seeking professional therapy in my adolescence, my journey has prioritized being “normal,” rather than having open and honest conversations that could have helped me find healing. I’ve only recently considered that normal should never have been my focus. I believe that normal is a subjective cultural and generational concept, bolstering the stigma surrounding mental illness.My mental health journey began in my pre-teen years when I was unaware of my deep-seated depression. I lived in the Appalachian Mountains with my mother and older brother after we all escaped from a violently abusive household. This was a time when my father could mask his bipolar disorder with an 80-hour work week and substance abuse. No one questioned the physical or emotional abuse he doled out, as this was a “normal” response for a man under financial stress at the time.I was a “latch-key kid” in the 1980s. For me, this meant essentially living alone in a house of four. When my ADHD reared its ugly head in the eighth grade, my teachers decided that it would be easier to hide me away in “in-school suspension” (ISS) — a six-by-eight-foot closet housing six desks and a one-way mirror for the teacher to observe us. If I wasn’t in ISS, I was in one-on-one counseling during school hours. But these sessions did not acknowledge the root of my challenges or even my potential for growth — they simply existed in an effort to mold me into something normal. Because I could never achieve this goal, I was quietly labeled as “mentally deficient.”I never took algebra; I took consumer math. I never took foreign languages or extra credit; I took summer school and received psychiatric intervention. This insufficient education and the decision to write me off as “deficient” were viewed as perfectly fine courses of action — just another step in the direction of normal.After high school and a move to Michigan, I quickly adapted to a life of substance abuse, developing an addiction to anything in reach. People around me failed to see this as another manifestation of my illness — it was seen as a normal way of acting out, done at the “appropriate” time — in my 20s. 30 years later, I look back and take note of how much I justified my substance use under the guise of it being seen as normal at the time.I finally realized that spending decades of my life trying to be normal wasn’t serving me. My struggles — and the insufficient response by the institutions that wrote me off instead of addressing my illness — continued to impact my well-being. Now that I have the gift of hindsight and perspective, I can see how normal got me where I am today; a place where I am still figuring out how to address my needs and access appropriate care. When I hear someone ask me, “Why can’t you just be normal for a change?” I hear someone who wants me to fit into a small box that eases their discomfort, like my teachers did in school.I cannot, and no longer seek to, control other people’s definitions of normal, as these socially-constructed perceptions only perpetuate stigma around mental health issues and make it harder for people to recover. Now I know that normal doesn’t matter; instead, I focus on healthy. The concept of achieving a state of healthy living provides two distinct advantages: It is self-defined, and it allows for specific and achievable goals. Healthy considers the reality of the situation (no matter how uncomfortable) and allows me to tailor my care to my needs.Achieving health is dictated through my choices and goals, no one else’s. It is an acute awareness of my mental and physical thresholds — and a deep respect for them. Healthy is not about how I react to you, but rather how I acknowledge myself as someone who can achieve more than normal.Erik A. Magnuson is father and husband living in Central Florida.

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.Adults ages 65 and older make up a large and growing segment of the U.S. population. The majority are “Baby Boomers,” a generation at high risk of suicide (and a generation that will carry this risk as they advance in years).More than 1 in 9 U.S. adults aged 65 and older experienced a mental illness in 2020. Yet, the mental health system poses significant barriers to care for older adults: there is a severe shortage of geriatric psychiatrists, and psychiatrists overall are more likely than other specialty providers to “opt out” of Medicare – the program that provides health insurance to nearly all Americans over age 65. Additionally, available mental health services are under-used by this demographic. This unquestionably heightens the role of mental illness as a strong risk factor for suicide in older adults.Ageism is another risk factor for suicide — it promotes the belief that depression is a normal part of aging, that older adults are preoccupied with increasing levels of illness, and that they may come to see suicide as an escape.Older adult suicides will rise as this population grows. However, younger age groups receive most suicide prevention attention. To change the broadening mental health conversation, advocacy groups, individuals and practitioners alike should embrace anti-ageism and anti-stigma efforts.Making these changes requires a deeper understanding of the current landscape and the impact of ageism.In 2020, men aged 65-74 had a suicide rate of 24.7/100,000, and men aged 75 and older had a rate of 40.5/100,000 – both higher than the overall national rate of 13.5/100,000. Notably, older adult suicide is predominantly a male phenomenon; the suicide rate of women aged 65-74 in 2020 was 5.6/100,000, and the rate among women aged 75 and older was 3.9/100,000.Older men at highest risk of suicide may:To address ageism, we first need to define it. Ageism is stigma directed toward aging and the aged. It consists of negative or patronizing attitudes, stereotypes and beliefs resulting in prejudicial or discriminatory treatment of older persons. In a national survey, 82% of older adults aged 50-80 reported experiencing some form of ageism in their everyday lives. While ageism is a common occurrence, it is a form of prejudice that is less likely to be recognized.Ageism makes the symptoms of depression and anxiety worse, increases stress and negatively affects overall mental health; and the impact on depression is particularly high in men.Studies show that ageism raises suicide risk by weakening protective factors, such as self-esteem, self-efficacy and hopefulness. This, in turn, may make someone feel like a burden or make them feel disconnected from their support system. These factors can lead to suicidal ideation and suicidal intent.Self-stigma may be the most harmful consequence of ageism. Internalizing the stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice often produces a negative self-assessment. Older people (particularly men) may come to believe that their life has no value, meaning or purpose — and that ending it would relieve others of the “burden.”Grassroots organizations and local mental health centers are a powerful counter to the stigma surrounding mental illness. They have a unique opportunity to raise awareness of how ageism stigmatizes older populations, makes them less likely to use mental health services and contributes to suicide risk in a high-risk group.As for practitioners, mental health providers must support geropsychiatric care, which is often in short supply in many communities. Accordingly, suicide prevention programs must put older men on the agenda at the county and state levels and implement suicide prevention programming aimed at older men.Additionally, the implementation of 988 as a national crisis line is an opportunity to reach more vulnerable populations. However, call center staff must be sensitive to the effects of ageism and know the risk factors and warning signs of suicide in older men.As Suicide Prevention Awareness Month ends, it’s important to think to the future, and how we can make changes every other month of the year. Hopefully, that will start with acknowledging and addressing this high-risk group.Tony Salvatore directs suicide prevention at Montgomery County Emergency Service, a nonprofit psychiatric hospital and crisis center in Norristown, PA.

My son’s story began well before the fateful night of Dec. 5, 2017, but it was this night that changed everything.My son, Tyler, found himself isolated, living in his car and feeling suicidal. After consuming lethal levels of alcohol and other drugs, he reached out to me for help, expressing his suicidal thoughts.Even though I am a physician assistant who occasionally handles mental health and substance abuse cases, I was completely lost when it came to my son being the one who needed help. His texts and calls were ambiguous, and I was confused by what he was telling me. Was he really contemplating suicide? Was this really happening?I contacted my mother, who lived near Tyler, and thankfully, she was able to locate him and his vehicle. On the other end of the phone, I could hear her exhale with relief. She opened the back-passenger car door, saw that Tyler was incoherent and crying, with an open wound on his forehead and made the decision to call emergency services.When the ambulance arrived, I asked to speak with the responders. I explained my level of experience and listed the psychiatric medications my son had recently taken. I also explained that I thought my son was having an uncharacteristic change in his mental status from a combination of his medication’s side effects and alcohol toxicity. I felt this could be contributing to his suicidal thoughts and behaviors — and asked that they provide that information to the attending physician or charge nurse in the emergency department.They said they would, but I don’t believe they did.When Tyler arrived at the hospital, disheveled and intoxicated, he was first treated as a disposable annoyance for the evening. Unfortunately, I didn’t find this surprising; in many cases, even trained professionals simply don’t know how to de-escalate a situation of this nature, so they often treat individuals with substance use disorder like criminals. That said, having a mental illness or substance abuse disorder does not equate to committing a crime. And being suicidal, in my son’s case, was a mental health crisis, not an unlawful act or a moral failing.When Tyler arrived at the medical center, he began begging the police officers to shoot him. He wanted to remove himself from the pain he couldn’t find a way to bear anymore. Tyler was put in restraints and given a sedative. After this, his ability to function with any control became impossible. The report states that, after waking up in a confused and scared state, realizing he had been tied down, Tyler started yelling and spitting. His medication-induced psychosis at that time was likely the reason, but there was no mention of this in the report.I don’t excuse my son’s actions, but I also don’t have the full story — and I know, based on his grandmother’s first-hand account of the situation, that the officer was irritated about having to “handle” an “addict.” Even though Tyler was under the influence, de-escalation should have been the tactic in this case, not verbal escalation from trained professionals with a suicidal patient.Some nurses later told me and my son that they expected difficult behavior in these situations and never take it personally. However, this officer did, and he charged my son with a felony.After my son’s psychiatric assessment, the social worker and board-certified physicians collectively determined that he needed immediate psychiatric care.Over the phone, the social worker told my husband and I that the officer would certainly take Tyler to a mental health treatment facility — and I had no reason to believe there was anywhere else he could possibly go.The next morning, after miraculously getting a flight into Texas, I assumed I would drive directly to the hospital to find my son there. Instead, I got a call from Tyler, who had been redirected to the county jail. He only had a minute to make his one call and inform me of his location.What began as both a physical and psychiatric emergency had turned into an incarceration and a felony. My mother, who had been at the hospital, told me that the deputy assigned to transfer Tyler was quite unhappy that he had to deal with another “drunk” in the middle of the night. He disregarded the directive to take my son to the psychiatric hospital and instead drove him to jail. He placed a bag over my son’s head and left his hospital gown gaping in the front leaving his naked body exposed.After arriving at the jail, my son sat on a bench for several hours in handcuffs, unable to cover himself and begged someone for some clothes. Eventually, he was put in a main cell with all the other unfortunate “criminals.”Within 24 hours, he would start the real process of withdrawal from alcohol. This is an incredibly dangerous experience — heart attacks, seizures and sudden death are all possibilities in alcohol withdrawal. And yet, at this critical point, my son was put into solitary confinement. He was held in a small cell with a urine and vomit-soaked mattress thrown on the floor near a gaping hole in the cement meant to be used as a toilet.He yelled out to find out what time it was periodically because the bright, fluorescent lights were never turned off, but nobody would answer him. He asked for water, but he was left thirsty. He was shaking uncontrollably in withdrawals, but it didn’t seem to matter. He was still suicidal, but that didn’t seem to be important to anyone.When I arrived in Austin, I drove directly to the jail. Tyler walked out in a jail issued jumpsuit, tears soaking his face. We sat down, looked at each other and bawled. I never thought I’d see my son in jail, but what was killing me in that moment was that just hours before, he had told me he wanted to end his life. I just kept thinking how scarring his experience must have been.After several additional years of self-destructive behavior, my son is healthy, happy and in recovery. I’m grateful to be able to say that now. But this is only after our family discovered that Tyler had experienced severe trauma as a teenager and grappled with the compounding effects of trauma from his treatment that night in hospital. We have been able to get him extensive counseling and treatment, and he is in a much better place in his life.But this happy conclusion could have been reached earlier. There is always more to the story — and I’ve always believed that if law enforcement or hospital staff had approached Tyler with empathy instead of annoyance, his healing could have begun sooner.After our traumatizing incident with law enforcement, I reached out to NAMI. They were the very first organization to actually listen to my story and give me guidance, resources and real help for my son. I am eternally thankful for their contributions at the time when we needed them most. They were the only ones who took the time, showed compassion and listened to my story when I just needed so desperately to be heard.Lisa M.

But, as the story goes, a friend helped them carry their belongings and that friend saved them from hurting themselves or ending their life.This story is quite inaccurate as it assumes an easy fix can solve a mental health problem, it misrepresents the severity of mental illness, and it minimizes the available resources that can help someone who is suffering from thoughts of suicide. Most notably, the story never addresses or resolves the reason for the student’s suicidal ideation — which was triggered by bullying in school. This is one of many possible journeys and only one of many outcomes. Mental health and people are much more complex.While that story does highlight the power of support, it does not reflect many people’s reality as they grapple with serious mental illness and suicidal ideation. The “savior culture” is a reductionist approach. It does not serve anyone who needs mental health support, nor does it allow for us to imagine the range of possibilities that in fact do exist for getting someone the help they need — based on what they are willing to access or what they have access to. Assuming the smallest of actions will “solve the problem” discounts the struggle of a person who suffers day in, day out, and it limits the options a loved one can take to offer help to someone with a serious mental illness.Major depression, for instance, does not necessarily look like this school-boy story; it’s more than one bad day, and it takes more than a kind gesture to tackle. And, even further, there are a range of lived experiences that fall under what major depression can look like for someone — so the level of severity is not fixed, just as there are no fixed solutions — this makes mental health professionals and various resources essential in the process.When I lost two dear people to suicide within a short time frame, my friend Mike and my cousin Lou, I started thinking about mental health more than ever before. I recalled the story about the student. I asked myself what I could have done to prevent their deaths. I recounted what I was doing during their final steps. The record played over countless times in my head as I thought about how they might have been here “if only” I had done something differently.What I’ve learned since then is this self-blame simply discounted every effort they made (and efforts also made by others) to try to address their mental health and reality every day. We need to stop that record from playing — it discounts the seriousness of the matter at hand and does not fully appreciate the struggle and pain that someone with mental illness is confronting and addressing every day.It also made me reflect on what I could do moving forward to raise awareness, to seek what resources are available and how we can better access and share them with others. I thought about how we might better understand people’s journeys with mental illness, and our own, as friends and family, who want to help them in the process.According to the CDC, suicide rates increased 30% between 2000-2018, with non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native men, and non-Hispanic white men, having some of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. Middle aged adults (aged 35-64) also fall among the most vulnerable groups. And although we know these trends — no one whose life ended by suicide is simply a statistic.So, how can we humanize who we are addressing and make sure that people have proper access to mental health care? How can we use what we know to change how we talk about mental health? How can changing the narrative impact the reality?Open dialogue is only helpful if we can share the truth. We can start talking about the reality of depression as it is, a legitimate medical condition that causes sadness, loss of interest and potentially feeling as if life is not worth living. It is a condition, not a weakness, that typically requires long-term mental health treatment.When it comes to “our role” in changing the reality on suicide and mental health, you can sign up and advocate for structural changes and greater support for mental health access.As for our own personal interactions with someone who needs or is seeking mental health assistance, here are some suggestions:If you or someone you know needs support, there are plenty of professional resources that would help you, including NAMI, SMI Advisor and others. The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health is also a wonderful resource that will help you see that you are not alone.I write this article in loving memory of my friend Michael J. “Mike” Malinowski and my cousin Lutfi “Lou” Mukhar. Each were beloved sons, brothers, friends, uncles, nephews, cousins and more. I could still hear Mike’s laughter echo in my ear even years after his departure from this earth. And I will never forget the way Lou would endearingly refer to me as “cousin.”Dr. Claudia Youakim is a sociologist and DEI expert who focuses on creating inclusive systems through evidence-based research and policy reform.

      "body": "Sending a child off to college is not easy for any parent. But when your child has mental illness, the process of letting go is even more difficult. The concerns I have as a parent are not unique; they are simply amplified by my daughter’s diagnoses. The stakes, given my family’s history, feel higher.While many families were celebrating Christmas in 2020, I was admitting Sheridan to the hospital because she was afraid she was going to harm herself. A year and a half later, Sheridan is getting ready to start her senior year of high school with her sights set on college. As she meets with her counselor to discuss the options, I am filled with a variety of emotions, namely excitement, pride and fear. A lot of fear.College students already grapple with a variety of challenges during their first year, and those with a history of depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder (or all three), like Sheridan, need extra support and a plan. For parents like me, this transition is not just about buying a cute duvet for the dorm.There are a significant number of parents in my position, given that approximately 41% of college students reported symptoms of depression last year and roughly 31% of all college students had already received an anxiety disorder diagnosis at some point in their lives. Additionally, 90% of counseling centers report an increased demand for mental health services. Clearly, my daughter is not alone.By talking about these issues with each other, and our children, we can help. I believe that when we discuss things, regardless of the situation, we build bridges that lead to solutions.It can be hard to initiate a conversation about mental health with a teenager — sometimes Sheridan doesn’t want to talk. At the same time, I am overwhelmed with fears that I want and need to talk about. I struggle with knowing when, how much and who to speak to. Sometimes I get it right and sometimes, I’m just not sure.The one time I got it right was last Christmas, which was the one-year anniversary of Sheridan being admitted to the hospital. Preemptively, I started talking to my kids. It was fruitful. My older daughter realized she had some triggers around Christmas and talked to her counselor about it. My other daughter did the same.As a family, we decided to keep the holiday as simple as possible. This wasn’t necessarily easy. I had to consciously work at saying no to invitations. We took it day by day, based on how we were feeling, andgot through it. I didn’t talk about it non-stop. Rather, I created the space where they could talk to me and let them know I was there for them. In doing so, we avoided additional triggers and stress.I’m also finding it helpful to respond rather than react — something that is easier said than done. “I think I want to go to a university in a city,” Sheridan said one morning.“ABSOLUTELY NOT!” shouted the voice in my head. The other voice said, “take a deep breath, Denise,” and “let’s get support.” I hired a college counselor and coach to help her think through the options.Yet, my fears remain.Recently, I was talking to a friend and realized that I could consult with Sheridan’s counselor about my fears and enlist her support. This reminded me that talking to trusted friends and family members often spark ideas I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. This is helpful because, in the absence of other perspectives, my mind (like many parents’) just makes lists of what could go wrong: Who will be there if she gets lost, loses her keys or something else goes wrong? What do I need to have in place to protect and support her? What do I need to do so I can be happy for her instead of worrying about her every second of the day?These may sound like normal maternal concerns, but when it comes to a child with mental illness, lost keys can become a crisis. Overwhelm can become life-threatening. This is not a fear; it’s a fact.I’d love to tell you that I have it all figured out. I’d love to leave you with a few solid takeaways, but this is what I know: it’s hard. I struggle with this every day. There is a lot I need to do to support Sheridan during this transition. There is a lot I need to do to support myself through this transition. And even though I know that I cannot fix Sheridan’s mental health challenges, I know that when I am resourced, I can show up as the parent I want to be and need to be. She deserves nothing less.Denise Mueller is senior executive in the biotech field. She is a mother of three beautiful daughters.

      "body": "When I finally got sober and started taking my prescribed medications correctly, I felt like I had a chance at life again. I was inspired by the 12-step programs and began to realize there was a mental health movement happening in my peer community — one that provided tools for recovery. I learned that, someday, I might even be able to work as a peer support specialist. So, as I began my recovery journey, I held onto that aspiration.I started off my job search with no real resumé, having worked less than a year in my entire life. I was turning 30, and I still had no idea how to communicate clearly or professionally. Sometimes, it felt like, “Uh…you wanna get some beer?” was about all I knew how to say. It took me some time to join the world around me and find meaningful passions and connections. I started volunteering places. I joined a project where we presented our recovery stories to other groups like nursing students and social work interns. I joined the community mental health board.As I took on these new tasks and challenges, I warmed up to the society I once rejected. The fact that I could create positive change made it worth it. My peers helped me see that there was a great life waiting for me. The community began to see my value — and I did, too.As I tackled the challenges in front of me and made strides in my recovery, I couldn’t wait to share what I had with anyone who could benefit. After all, I had the experience of developing a formula that worked for me: get active, join a social group that is part of something positive, build a resume volunteering.This path allowed me to escape a sedentary lifestyle — one in which I was always using drugs or trying to get drugs. One in which I was chasing away the voices with alcohol, committing small crimes and rejecting everything that didn’t reinforce my self-destructive lifestyle. This lifestyle landed me in psychiatric hospitals for months at a time (seven visits in total). But now, I understood that there was a way out. I could find both peace and freedom.I would never have “made it” without my peers who blazed this trail. Knowing I could follow in their footsteps — emulate their paths to recovery and even go on to help others myself — was amazing. I wanted to help people find their way out of darkness like I did. Beyond that, I wanted them to make it all the way to the other side, believing we could each actualize our visions.Today, I feel like peer support has the power to bring us all closer to our dreams. I encourage my peers to never underestimate our potential or limit our goals. While “I just want to keep taking my meds,” or “I want to stay out of the hospital this year,” may seem like good starting points, there is so much more we can aspire to.I am not any “further down the path” than anyone else. Some may excel in one particular area, and I may excel in another. I may need their help, or they may need mine. The point is that recovery is contagious. We just need something to be inspired by and excited about. In this case, it is sharing our triumph, our survival. Transforming a system that may have let us down and handing down what was given to us.Today, I work with my peers, and we volunteer with local projects and plan our own volunteer activities. We plan recovery events for the larger mental health community. We reach out to our neighbors. We are a part of the world and society. We fight stigma every day.To me, peer support is more than a job where you expose people to recovery. We have the chance to inspire. The people we join inspire us. Our energy, as a collective, branches out to our community. We may have had setbacks, but we come out ahead as leaders, sharing valuable experiences that can bring healing to the rest of society.Patrick Kaufmann’ s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” which was released on Sept. 20.

      "body": "Our nation’s mental health crisis is arguably at an all-time high. The demand for treatment has soared, exacerbating the shortage of mental health providers and adding to their already-significant waitlists. We are confronted with the ultimate health care supply chain problem — it takes almost a decade to train a psychiatrist and more than six years to train a licensed social worker. And we simply can’t wait that long.The dire shortage of mental health professionals and increased demand for providers, coupled with insurance issues and coverage gaps, leave many people without adequate access to mental health care. And for marginalized populations, the lack of access to culturally appropriate mental health care is even more dire.We are two psychiatrists working in the national mental health advocacy arena, representing hundreds of thousands of families as well as clinical and scientific advances, and we believe a non-clinical solution can help immediately: peer support.People often assume that talking about mental health (and suicidal thoughts) may make the situation worse. In the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s (AFSP) 2020 Harris Poll, over 90% of American adults say they would want to help someone in their life who is feeling suicidal, however a majority say they need knowledge or skills to effectively engage. Of those polled who were struggling, 69% identified barriers that keep them from discussing their experiences with others, including shame, fear of judgment or not knowing what to say.Every culture has its own version of beliefs that perpetuate stigma: “buck up and stay strong,” “don’t show weakness,” “men don’t cry.” A multitude of beliefs rooted in a time when mental health was poorly understood discourage open communication and have the unintended consequence of keeping people suffering in silence. We know that isolating and keeping distress hidden not only leaves mental health problems to fester and worsen — it also increases the risk of suicide.However, one positive outcome of the pandemic has been that the universal rise in mental health distress led to progress in acknowledging what has always been true: it’s human to struggle, and we need each other to get through difficult times.Like never before, more of us are talking about the full spectrum of mental health experiences, including loneliness, pain and the comparison game (where we never seem good enough compared with others). More of us are sharing on deeper levels with family, friends, colleagues and even strangers. We also have new opportunities through support groups, social media and even workplace groups to find other people who are experiencing similar mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, substance use, PTSD, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.In NAMI’s new book “You Are Not Alone,” more than 125 people interviewed attested to their experience that shame and stigma still prevent many conversations around mental health.  When they began having open conversations about their struggles, they began to experience profound insights, connection and progress. These interviewees volunteered to share their stories and use their real names in the book to reduce the shame and isolation they knew well. These brave testimonials have the potential to positively affect others who are struggling with their mental health. The radical idea that living with a mental health condition is nothing to be ashamed of and may even be considered a form of expertise (lived experience in the mental health advocacy world) — is both powerful and underused.Support groups are not a substitute for professionals. They are a resource that can offer people something unique: connection and the certainty that they are not alone. The peer movement is thriving on virtual platforms as well as in person, and there are many free, accessible and credible resources within reach to connect to peer support groups:As psychiatrists who both had turning points in our own lives related to lived experience or suicide loss, we were able to bring our full selves to this work through speaking from not only our clinical and scientific expertise, but also from our lived experience. Within our nationwide networks at NAMI and AFSP, we are witnessing the healing power of connection through shared experiences.By speaking out, we not only receive validation and support, but we realize that we can offer comfort and hope to others. Those who want to do more can learn how to invite dialogue, truly listen without judgment and have deeper conversations. More than ever, our society is saying it wants and needs guidance to engage in these conversations in supportive ways, which means increasing cultural awareness, humility and availability around helpful resources to reach everyone.Of course, we need many more professionals and ways to bring them into this remarkable and rewarding field. In the meantime, those experiencing mental health challenges should know that there are people who understand, who can offer support and help them move forward. You’ll be surprised how opening up more authentic conversations and connecting with peer support are two avenues that can help in powerful ways.Christine Yu Moutier, M.D., serves as Chief Medical Officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.Ken Duckworth, M.D. serves as NAMI’s Chief Medical Officer.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "At some point in our lives, many of us will try psychotherapy and then decide whether to continue to engage in a full course of treatment with that provider (which may last for weeks, months or years). This decision is, typically, based on a judgment of whether the benefits of a course of psychotherapy with a given provider are worth the cost in terms of finances, time and effort.Through conversations with friends, family and colleagues, we have come to believe that most psychotherapy clients don’t know how to judge whether they are receiving quality treatment that will help them to achieve their goals. To facilitate this judgment and decision, we propose 10 questions for any client to ask their provider.All therapists should be willing and able to provide “good” answers to these questions no later than the third session. Good answers provide information that will help you assess your therapist’s competence, whether treatment is evidence-based and time-limited and whether your therapist will systematically monitor your problems/symptoms/challenges. Good answers will also clarify your therapist’s views on your case and make clear whether treatment aligns with your goals and values.“Bad” answers, by contrast, provide no useful information. They are vague, unclear, confusing or indicate you are receiving less than ideal treatment, perhaps from an unqualified therapist.Ultimately, discussion guided by these 10 questions can build trust and facilitate your therapeutic relationship. Be empowered to ask these questions and find a therapist and treatment who best suits your needs.A good answer might go something like this: “You have asked for my help to reduce your symptoms of worry. I will address these issues, by helping you to increase your psychological flexibility while living according to your values.”A bad answer may look like this: “It will require more sessions for me to know and to be able to tell you.”A good answer could sound like: “Your worries seem to attach themselves to everything you think about. You feel like the worry helps you to avoid bad outcomes, but your life has become small. You spend most of your time at home, where you feel safe, but isolated, numb and depressed.”A possible bad answer might sound like: “We’ll figure this out together.”Good answer: “Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), I will help you to identify and live according to your values despite your worries. Your life will become bigger, and you will react less to particular states of mind and mood.”Bad answer: “Whatever you want it to be.”Good answer: “You will learn to use a variety of techniques to live according to your values in the present moment regardless of the challenges you face. For example, you will learn acceptance and mindfulness techniques.”Bad answer: “You have to experience the treatment to understand how it works.”Good answer: “In the first session, you completed measures of psychological flexibility, mindfulness, depression and worry. You will complete all measures again at the end of treatment, and some measures a few additional times. Improvement will be indicated by higher scores on measures of psychological flexibility and use of mindfulness, with no change or less depression and worry.”Bad answer: “Sometimes I will ask you if you are doing any better than when you began therapy. I will try to do this on a regular basis.”Good answer: “This treatment will require approximately 12, 50-minute sessions. In approximately the tenth session, we will examine your scores on the measures completed that week to determine whether we can stop therapy after the twelfth session, or if it would be better to add a few more sessions.”Bad answer: “I don’t know how many sessions this will take. We will know when to stop when you feel better.”Good answer: “I expect you to be on time, be sober, be open and honest and to complete homework assignments between sessions. I will regularly ask for updates regarding your well-being and functioning, and for feedback regarding how you think we are doing.”Bad answer: “I expect you to trust that I know what I’m doing, and to follow my lead throughout therapy. I expect you not to ask a lot of questions. I am the expert. You can expect me to help you to get better.”Good answer: “There are other psychotherapies that might help you, including cognitive therapy. Medications, such as venlafaxine, might also be helpful.”Bad answer: “This is the best treatment for your problem. I wouldn’t worry about other treatments.”Good answer: “There is modest research support for ACT for anxiety disorders and for depression. I will provide you with a website address where you can review articles about the treatment and supporting evidence.”Bad answer: “The type of treatment I practice can be applied to fix just about any problem. I’ve had a lot of clients who improved from my treatment.”Good answer: “I received training in ACT for anxiety and for depression from an accredited graduate school and internship and have practiced ACT professionally for 10 years.”Bad answer: “I have many years of experience.”Ultimately, when we make the choice to begin psychotherapy, we have to keep in mind some practical considerations. Is this process helpful and worth the time, money and effort? As a client, you have the right to clear communication from your therapist as you navigate these questions. We hope that our guiding questions will help start an important conversation.As a program evaluator and researcher with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Office of Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Matt Boden, Ph.D. directs efforts to improve the mental health of Veterans and their treatment providers.

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.Sept. 17 marks the fifth annual National Physician Suicide Awareness Day, a day dedicated to preventing suicide and reminding physicians that they are not alone. NAMI supports physician mental health and wants to ensure that access to support — and caring for those who care for us — remains a priority.Physician suicide is a topic historically shrouded in stigma and secrecy. While an exact statistic is difficult to pinpoint, we know some estimates show that suicide affects doctors at a rate that is 1.4 – 2.3 times higher than the general population. Clearly, there is a need for awareness and action.If you’re a physician, it’s time to talk about it.Suicide is a complex problem, with multiple risk factors that can change with time, and rarely due to a singular cause or event. This is true for everyone, including physicians. However, there are additional factors particular to the profession of medicine.For example, physicians are problem-solvers, healers who undergo rigorous training — and this mindset may make it difficult to accept that you need support. You may subject yourself to unrealistic standards of perfection and may judge your self-worth by whether or not you reach them. Constantly striving for perfection can take a toll on you over time.Additionally, you may experience trauma and moral injury in the course of your work, and these factors can lead to depression and substance use, as well as suicidal thoughts. Physicians of all specialties also face burnout, a stress reaction that builds up over time and results in mental exhaustion, cynicism and a sense of hopelessness. Prolonged stress can have a serious effect on both physical and mental health, and burnout is a common reason for leaving the field of medicine.“Burnout has many dimensions — psychological, physical, spiritual and more — but in the simplest of terms, it is an erosion of the soul. And that is an awful feeling, one that alarms and saddens doctors, who seriously question why they went into medicine in the first place.” – Dr. Michael Myers.While diagnostically different, burnout, moral injury and depression share many overlapping features, including a significant impact on mood, sleep and energy levels. These factors interact in complex ways and can sometimes be difficult to differentiate.You may resent that your treatment decisions are often hampered or overruled by distant bureaucratic or insurance-driven dictates. You may also become frustrated by having to devote more time to electronic health records and other administrative burdens than patient care — the very reason you chose to become a physician. These are frequent causes of burnout.Scenarios like these can also result in moral injury, as physicians are sometimes unable to alter the course of care decisions that are beyond their control, yet medically and ethically flawed. Or you may face the rising frequency of treating victims of senseless trauma, scenarios that expose you to suffering and lead to a loss of empathy or feelings of intense anger.While those suffering from burnout may not necessarily experience moral injury or develop depression, it’s important for you to understand the symptoms you’re experiencing, so you can access the kind of support needed to regain a sense of well-being.It’s also key to preventing an escalation of symptoms. Untreated symptoms of depression can be dangerous, as depression is a major factor in suicide. Similarly, if you’re experiencing burnout that hasn’t yet led to depression, managing stress and finding solutions to specific challenges can help you prevent negative mental and physical effects from worsening.Don’t let stigma convince you that it’s “just burnout.” Identify what you’re feeling, be aware of warning signs, and explore options for support.Even physicians who recognize warning signs may still struggle to access support. Personal stigma or concerns over how colleagues or family might react may make you hesitant to seek treatment. Or maybe you feel reluctant to focus on your own distress and mental health symptoms when the patients you treat are battling illnesses that are “visible” or “testable.” There may not be a blood test for depression, but it still presents in the form of mental and physical symptoms, and treating those symptoms can help you feel better. Your patients would never want you to suffer in silence — neither would your peers and loved ones.Even aside from these concerns, physicians in many states face an additional risk: the fear of professional repercussions if they seek mental health support. You may worry about losing your license, hospital privileges and job if you disclose access to mental health treatment.NAMI believes that this is unacceptable – seeking treatment should be encouraged without such fear. We’ve taken a stand on this issue with a public policy statement regarding licensure application questions on mental health for medical professionals:NAMI supports limiting medical license application questions about mental health to only those necessary and relevant to assess an individual’s current ability to practice medicine safely and competently. NAMI further supports and encourages the use of language in the licensure application process that is supportive of seeking mental health treatment.”Medical professionals who would like access to confidential support are not alone. NAMI Frontline Wellness offers resources for professional support options that protect your privacy. You can also find information on warning signs, when to reach out for support, how to build resilience and strategies for wellness.You can also download the National Physician Suicide Awareness Day toolkit, which contains tips and resources for individuals and organizations. Share these resources with peers, your leadership and hospital or practice administrators.Remember that you and your peers are also a resource for support. If you’re struggling, or notice that a colleague appears to be, don’t wait. Taking action can be as simple as having a conversation that begins with, “It’s been rough around here the past few days. Are you doing ok?”Asking simple questions and acknowledging that your colleague seems to be struggling lets them know that someone cares and they don’t have to struggle alone. As a physician, you know what other physicians face, and that experience can make peer support invaluable. Talking through challenges and concerns and sharing strategies for wellness can help generate new ideas and motivation for self-care for both of you.You face many challenges and stressors each day, but there are ways to effectively cope with the resulting experiences and emotions. As you work hard to take care of your patients, remember that you’re at your best when you also care for your own health.If you or someone you know is in crisis, there are resources you can turn to.The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline offers free, confidential crisis counseling 24/7/365 just by dialing or texting 988.If you don’t want to talk on the phone, you can also text the Crisis Text Line for free 24/7 mental health support.

      "body": "On Aug. 27, 2012, I was admitted to the hospital again. I had been in a hypomanic/manic state for quite some time, and I began experiencing delusions and psychosis. I was 48 years old and had been cycling through the system (more often in the hospitals than out) for over 24 years. I was living in a 2005 Ford Taurus. I had lost my job, lost my family, lost my boyfriend and lost my hope. I was tired.While in the hospital, I attended groups (most of which I could lead as I had attended them so many times), I started back on my medications and made progress in my recovery. After five days, administrators told me that I was ready to be discharged, but I first needed to attend one more group. I was not interested in participating. In fact, my plan after leaving the hospital was to return to my car and take my life.That was the mindset with which I went to the group. To my surprise, it was not the usual group meeting — it was a NAMI In Our Own Voice presentation. I listened while two presenters shared their stories. One of the individuals, who was living a life I had only dreamed of, revealed that she had a diagnosis that was similar to mine. She shared she was married, had three children, worked a job she found fulfilling, attended college and volunteered to go back in the community and share her story of recovery. As they finished their presentations, I was in tears. The young lady came over to me, handed me her card and said that when I was discharged to give her a call, as she would like to talk with me further.That presentation was life changing for me. For the first time since my initial diagnosis in 1989 (when “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” was the movie of relevance), I had hope.The next day I was discharged. Instead of taking my life, I made the choice to call the local NAMI affiliate.I was provided resources to connect with the local homeless shelter, health department for trauma counseling and the NAMI Connection support groups. The local affiliate gave me a safe place to be where I felt accepted. They allowed me to use one of my passions (data entry) to support them as they needed assistance transferring data from one system to another — even though I was still experiencing symptoms.After participating in support groups, I was asked to train to become a facilitator. Shortly after, I was provided the opportunity to become a NAMI In Our Own Voice presenter. I also took the NAMI Peer-to-Peer class and started using the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), in which I learned skills that would assist me in managing my chronic health conditions.Today, I live a life that far exceeds any delusion I ever had (and I had some pretty good ones).All these experiences have led me to where I am today in my wellness journey, and I have learned the power of hope, shared experiences and peer support. That’s why I am so glad to be included in NAMI’s first-ever book “You Are Not Alone.” I never want anyone to feel the way I did — I want them to have the support I found when I got involved in the NAMI community. My insightful conversations with Dr. Duckworth during the creation of this book allowed me to I reflect on the experiences and successes in recovery.  I wish this type of book had been available for me to read at the beginning of my mental health journey.Kimberly Comer’s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” releasing on Sept. 20.

      "body": "“Yes, I am a prisoner of sorts, but my prison isn't the house. It's my own thoughts that lock me up!” – V.C. AndrewsIntrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts that can pop up in our minds unannounced, at any time. Their repeated occurrence can make it hard to focus on daily tasks and sustain healthy relationships. They can be a symptom of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).To address these often-debilitating thoughts and advance the conversation on mental illness, we need to understand how they manifest themselves in each mental health condition.Generalized Anxiety DisorderPeople with generalized anxiety disorder can battle impaired concentration, difficulty sleeping and excessive worry when intrusive thoughts pop into their minds. For instance, they may have repeated worrisome thoughts about someone getting hurt or developing an illness. They may worry that they will lose their job.These thoughts are not based on facts or past results — rather they are irrational and unlikely. However, they can seem very real and probable to someone who ruminates on them. These thoughts can be concerning to loved ones, especially when they start controlling the person’s behavior.DepressionRumination can also accompany depression. In this case, when a person has a problem, they may find themselves thinking about it repeatedly and analyzing it for hours. The person may focus more on problems instead of solutions, and this may stop them from undertaking important tasks.Examples of intrusive thoughts that accompany depression include seeing situations as “black- and-white,” assuming it will end disastrously because of past bad outcomes or viewing small mishaps in a magnified way. Another way in which intrusive thoughts affect people who have depression is that they can sometimes try to predict what someone is thinking, even if there’s no rationale for it. This can be distressing and take a toll on anxiety levels.Obsessive-Compulsive DisorderA 2020 study published in the journal PLOS showed that people with OCD may place less trust in their past experiences, leading to greater uncertainty, indecisiveness and explorative behaviors. In this study, the researchers asked 58 participants with various levels of OCD symptoms to complete a decision-making task by thinking about their reaction to past experiences and comparing them to more recent ones. The findings showed that participants with higher levels of OCD symptoms were less trusting of past experiences. As such, their environment seemed consistently unpredictable.This mistrust may cause intrusive urges, images or thoughts to arise, resulting in behavioral rituals, also known as compulsions. These can vary from compulsive handwashing, checking locks or switches or the repetitive pulling of hair (trichotillomania) or compulsive skin picking.Managing Stress LevelsExperiencing a high level of stress can cause intrusive thoughts. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the genetic factors that cause sleep problems when some people are stressed are the same that can make people with intrusive, ruminative thoughts have a higher rate of insomnia.This is one of the reasons why some of the most successful methods for battling anxiety and intrusive thinking involve curbing stress before it becomes a problem. In order to reduce stress and anxiety, developing emotional awareness is key. Signs that one is stressed include racing heart, experiencing changes in the stomach or bowel and having difficulty concentrating.Scientifically-proven means of reducing stress include controlled breathing, mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts into more positive ones. Journaling, soothing fragrances (such as therapeutic-grade essential oils like lavender or orange), spending time in nature, yoga, meditation and exercise have all been found to lower stress hormone (cortisol) levels.Prioritizing SleepOne of the most important strategies for keeping intrusive thoughts or rumination at bay is to get quality sleep. Research produced by scientists at Binghamton University found that sleeping less than eight hours a night is linked to intrusive, repetitive thoughts. The researchers showed participants a series of images that were intended to produce emotional responses. They found that those who had experienced regular sleep disruptions had greater difficulty in shifting their attention away from negative information.Identify the Root of the FearIn addition to battling stress and embracing good sleep hygiene, people who have intrusive thoughts can also take a behavioral approach to this issue. One useful strategy is to identify the root causes of the disturbance. By knowing your core values and identifying your boundaries, it becomes easier to identify why specific situations or experiences provoke disgust, fear or other distressing emotions.For example, you may have experienced loss — perhaps the untimely death of someone you loved. This may begin to affect you negatively in other areas of your life. You may worry or experience intrusive thoughts that someone else close to you may pass suddenly, or in the same way. To help deal with this, you may develop repetitive behaviors that you think are going to solve the problem or stop it from happening.Rather than suppressing intrusive thoughts, you can take a mindful approach, accepting them without judgement but knowing that they do not define you and despite their strength, you can maintain healthy thinking processes.Facing Intrusive Thoughts Head-OnYou should avoid “running away” from situations that can cause you stress, as this can push you into rumination. If you find that intrusive thoughts severely or persistently interfere with your health and well-being, consider seeing a therapist. Approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you understand the vital link between your thoughts, emotions and behaviors. Your therapist can suggest behavioral changes and ask you to recognize how these changes affect the way you think or feel about a situation. They can also help you reframe negative thoughts into positive ones.People who find that intrusive thoughts are exacerbating mental conditions like depression, anxiety and OCD should seek professional help — as should those who are unable to undertake daily tasks or sustain relationships because of intrusive thoughts. Therapy combined with medication and a holistic approach to health and self-care are important ways forward in the healing and wellness process. What works well for one person may not for another, so finding a personalized way to deal with these issues is the best way forward.Jackie Edwards is a freelance writer who has had lifelong experience of anxiety and depression.

      "body": "My name is Judith Marie Kuzmak Viers, or just Judy. And my childhood friends call me Judes. My neighbor used to sing the Beatles song \"Hey Jude,\" which includes the lyrics, \"take a sad song and make it better.” That lyric is why I choose to share my story. Beyond being a music fan, I'm a mom, a writer, an artist, a hiker and a dancer. And I try to make the world a better place.I have been on my own mental health journey and witnessed the painful turns in the journeys of others; I lost two loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic to suicide. I don't want anyone else to go down that road. I want people to know that every day is a new day and we should never give up on life.I hope that my own story and struggle will help someone else and inspire them to take the next step in their own healing journey.I started suffering from symptoms of depression at 12 years old when my newborn sister died. Having been raised Christian, I was devastated by her death and that my prayers for her life were not answered. Yet, I also truly believed I could pray the depression away. By my 30s, several years after my mom lost her battle to breast cancer, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began experiencing severe manic episodes.I began to feel like I was a hopeless cause. When I was depressed, I believed that whoever tried to help me would be dragged into my deep dark hole of despair. So, I stayed silent. There were days when the only thing I did was breathe, drink water and eat a little junk food — I didn’t even go outside. I remember trying to speak or write, but I wasn’t able to do so because I experienced brain fog as a symptom of my depression.My hopelessness got to the point where I began to doubt every positive prior experience. I eventually got treatment because of something my father said to me years earlier. In 2003, after the funeral of my young neighbor who died by suicide, my dad said that suicide is “the worst thing that can happen to a parent.” Those words resonated with me. In 2011, I was in a low state, had difficulty sleeping, experienced racing thoughts and even developed a plan to end my life. But I remembered my dad’s words and voluntarily went to the hospital to be safe. Even though my mind said, “the world would be better off without you,” my dad’s words rang true, and I know my actions would devastate him.The depression eventually faded, but then I began experiencing the highs of mania. Having a manic episode is traumatic and embarrassing — and processing the shame you feel for your thoughts and actions while manic is a complex, lifelong process. I was involuntarily hospitalized multiple times for mania.For 20 years, I prayed alone in my room, hoping that my depression and mania would go away, but I never found any long-lasting success. Then I discovered that prayer without action does not work for me — and I need to rely on several different wellness tools.Part of my recovery required admitting that I need professional help too. My personal coping mechanisms and spirituality were not enough to tackle my bipolar disorder alone. Now, I work with an incredible therapist. In therapy, I share everything I am doing, like being a NAMI In Our Own Voice Presenter, and assess if any of my words or behaviors seem manic. I have a plan in place where two close friends or family members can contact my therapist if they are worried that I'm manic, since I can be more receptive to hearing that I am manic if I can process the information with my therapist. I also work with a wonderful psychiatrist who knows my history of adverse side effects to medications and makes sure to prescribe appropriate doses.I also make sure to maintain social connections. I am good friends with the director of On Our Own of Carroll County, a wellness and recovery nonprofit organization that has helped be throughout my mental health journey. I still use my coping tools of going church and spending time with my close friends.Now, I understand that being able to seek and find the help I need was the answer to my prayer. Oftentimes, we need to step out of our comfort zone to get the help we need. While my faith was temporarily affected by my mental illness, it is now so much stronger. Life truly can be a healing journey.I imagine being 90 years old and thinking about my life with peace and pride that I truly did the best I could. That concept of living the best life I can — doing what is on my heart — is my greatest motivation and my definition of success.I already had my master’s degree in social work before I was hospitalized or received mental health treatment. But what took me years to learn from books, I was truly able to internalize through lived experience — and I learned so much more about the extremes of bipolar disorder through my own experience than I could have learned from a textbook. I understand how to relate to others. I can empathize with those experiencing depression and mania. I remember the lies I believed — that life will never get better and you can’t open up about your struggles to loved ones. I now know nothing in life is permanent, even severe mental illness can be treated and friendships are built by being open in the good and bad times. Not only have I been on my own healing journey, I can help others in their journeys as well.I've even started a non-profit, Share Hope Through Art, to use art as a way to share my story. I incorporate sayings like \"you matter\" and \"the world is better with you in it\" into my work. I'm not sure what my future holds, but I hope to continue to find peace in knowing that I’m doing the best I can. Right now, it's being the best mom I can be and doing what I can to be a ray of hope in people's lives. I want to illustrate how hope and healing are possible — and we should never give up on life.Judith Marie Kuzmak Viers is the founder of Share HOPE through ART and an author.

      "body": "Being a Black woman with a mental health condition poses serious challenges to living life to its fullest. I have faced discrimination, exclusion and barriers to both care and opportunities. However, living with a mental health condition has been the most difficult of my three marginalized identities; I constantly have to prove why I deserve respect and dignity, why I am not dangerous, why I am not a failure and why I am just a person.False narratives about mental illness pervade every part of our society — and being bombarded by stereotypes and misinformation takes its toll and adds to the challenge of maintaining my emotional wellness. My recovery required finding the right people, places and resources, while trying to make a difference in my community and sharing my story.My healing really began when I became a member of NAMI. The NAMI In Our Own Voice (IOOV) training and support groups helped me grow, accept and embrace who I am. They also taught me to be resilient. As a certified public accountant, I particularly enjoyed sharing my own IOOV story at law firms, financial institutions and schools because, despite one’s socioeconomic status and education, anyone can have a mental health condition.Later I joined Fountain House, a nonprofit organization that provided me with a support system — people who understand my experience and avoid making judgments. I love just being myself and not pretending to be “ok” all the time, as I have had to do in other environments. For instance, when I'd show up in a work environment, I’d make every effort not to talk to myself and not to look different because people were watching. But at Fountain House, if I talked to myself, they wouldn’t think anything of it.In this community, I have been able to build relationships and meet people where they are: whether they're well, becoming unwell or even in a crisis. We’re able to build rapport and trust with each other, and our goal becomes empowering our peers.Far too often, policies and programs for people with mental illness are created in a top-down approach. I always say, \"No, no, no. It has to be from peer up. It's about us.\" Throughout my mental health journey, I have learned that we know how best to engage with other people who look, walk, talk and act like us. We speak the same language.Navigating a mental health journey is exhausting work and resilience. I had a long history of pain and trauma to overcome; I grew up in a verbally and physically abusive home. My mother was unwell and treated me as though I was \"bad person and a problem.\" If you hear words like this for long enough, you start to believe it. I grew up alone and afraid. But somehow, I survived. And my efforts toward resilience and survival taught me that changing a situation requires my resourcefulness to devise a solution. Now, I thrive on making positive changes in the community and helping others. It’s also cathartic and a critical part of my own recovery.One of the positive changes I have focused on is improving outcomes when people who are unhoused or living with mental health conditions and substance use disorders interact with police during emergencies. I designed a peer-driven emergency response model called the Person–Centered Intervention Training (PCIT) Mental Health Response Pilot in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY.PCIT consists of two parts: training and response. The training component teaches participants how to use person-centered, strength-based and culturally responsive language when engaging with people. Care and Empathy are so important in helping people. For the response component, crisis-trained peers or a Social Well-Being Team (SWBT) tour Fort Greene Park respectfully connecting with park patrons. SWBT’s goal is to destigmatize mental health, validate people’s experiences, provide emotional support and connect people to treatment while diverting them from the justice system.A big step in my journey was sharing my story with Dr. Ken Duckworth for his upcoming book, “You Are Not Alone.” I felt it was important to participate in the project because I wanted to inspire and give hope to others, particularly people of color. I want people to know that recovery is a journey, but it is rewarding and possible.I wish that I had been given access to role models or mentors when I struggled to manage and cope with my condition (at work, with family and in relationships). I hope that by reading this book, people will find the answers that they are seeking. We are not alone, and we all need support.Christina Sparrock’s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” releasing on September 20.

      "body": "If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor. You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.If you are reading this, you likely know that suicide is often a product of incomprehensible pain, and results in the heavy grief that suicide loss leaves in its wake.As behavioral health professionals, concerned family members and friends, we know even the most radiant individuals have attempted and died by suicide. Where others see statistics, we recall faces and names.This National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, it is important that we assess the state of suicide and take a few moments to remind ourselves of the basic, and sometimes overlooked, steps we can take to help those at risk of suicide.In June of 2020, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that about twice as many people reported having serious thoughts of suicide than they did prior to the pandemic. Although the pandemic did not lead to the dramatic increase in completed suicides as some had predicted, rates remain high. The most recent full-year statistics, for 2020, found that 45,979 people died of suicide.The CDC also found that suicide was the second leading cause of death among people ages 10-14 and 25-34. Research also found that some 1.2 million Americans attempted suicide and rates of suicide are highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives and people over the age of 85.The pandemic created more stressors to mental health issues, adding to an already strained mental health crisis. Multiple issues continue to fuel it, among them young peoples’ social media-influenced feelings of inadequacy, increasing rates of substance abuse, financial stress caused by inflation and an increasingly divisive political landscape.It is fitting that September is also National Recovery Month. In 2020, 40.3 million people in the U.S. over the age of 12 had a substance use disorder in the past year. Our national substance abuse crisis continues to dramatically impact suicide rates today.The demand for mental health services continues to outpace available resources. Many mental health providers who transitioned to Telebehavioral health during the pandemic do not wish to go back in-office. The rents and general costs of maintaining an office have gone up, and many providers would rather not have those expenses. Although these providers are still available via Telebehavioral health, members may face a shortage if they prefer to see a provider in person.While there are disparities among different populations, many still experience stigma surrounding mental health and suicidal ideation. However, we’re seeing some progress, particularly among younger generations that increasingly see the value and need for mental health-oriented care. The rollout of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline also reflects a dramatic shift in public attitudes towards suicide prevention and is a significant victory.Given the state of suicide, how can we, as behavioral health professionals, concerned family members and friends help prevent suicide? The first step is to revisit the basics:Successful public health efforts incorporate public advocacy and learning. We must continue to advocate for depression and suicidal ideation screening in every primary care visit. Just as importantly, education is crucial. This includes helping family members and friends have easy access to informational resources they can use to help those in mental distress.Indifference, prolonged sadness and a sudden desire to give away prized possessions, are just a few of the signs to watch for. Individuals who are experiencing a crisis, like the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, the loss of a job or a significant financial loss are also at increased risk of depression and by extension possibly suicidal ideation.Don’t be afraid to ask someone how they feel, if something is wrong or share with them that you have noticed they are not their usual self. Then listen without judgment.Those contemplating suicide may hesitate to get help on their own, but you can help by offering to accompany them to visit a provider, to stay with them while phoning the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or even call 988 yourself to get help for someone else who is in crisis.

      "body": "Octopi. Octopuses. I don't care how you pluralize them; I just love them. But I never gave much thought to this deep-water creature until recently.I was having lunch with a colleague who is an astrobiologist. I love the ocean, and I brought up that I was going to an aquarium. She said I should see the aquarium’s octopus show and continued to talk about how magnificent octopi are. Then, she mentioned a recent study (and TED Talk) determining how an octopus functions: each of the creature’s eight “arms” is covered in hundreds of “suckers” — and each of these suckers contains thousands of receptors (for comparison, human fingers only have a few hundred receptors). Essentially, each sucker senses its surroundings and sends the information back to the main brain of the octopus. Additionally, each arm of the octopus can move either with the main brain or independently.At the time, I thought the study sounded interesting and moved on with the conversation.It wasn't until a year later when I was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that I really thought about what my colleague was saying. Each sucker can be independent or work together with the main brain.As I thought more about what my colleague had told me, I decided to learn more. Sometimes, I found, the tiny individual brains in the suckers do not agree, so the suckers and arms may act differently. For example, one sucker may think something is food, but a sucker on another arm may think it is a threat. So, while one of the octopus’s arms is wrapping around it, another arm may be pulling away.The arms can do all this while bypassing the octopus’s main brain, meaning the main brain may not be aware of what is going on in the octopus’s extremities.If you have DID or know someone living with it, this may sound familiar. One identity (also known as an “alter” or a “part”) may experience something that “main” identity is unaware of, or several identities may react to the same stimulus in opposite ways.The comparison really struck me: the suckers of an octopus function much like the identities of someone with DID.Those of us with DID have experienced this phenomenon at work. The host functions much like the main brain of the octopus. Two alters, like the octopus’s suckers, may not agree on how to handle a situation. Or one alter may not even know another exists. Each alter experiences the world in a unique way, and they respond according to their past experiences. However, the person may or may not know what their alters are doing — so the \"main brain\" may not be aware of how the \"suckers\" react.Ultimately, the suckers, arms and main brain of the octopus work together for survival, and the octopus is able to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. Even though the various parts of the system may not all agree, they work together to protect and nourish the octopus. Without each individual sucker, the octopus would not be able to survive its environment.That is exactly why we have our alters: survival. They protect us and allow us to thrive in harsh conditions. They each have their own experiences and responses to situations, but ultimately, they are present to help us thrive.If we look at an octopus as a microcosm for how our own DID brains can work together, we can see how it is possible to thrive when alters disagree, even in the harshest conditions.When I first became aware of and met some of my alters, I was scared. I didn't know why, but I found them terrifying. However, I eventually realized that my alters were a coping mechanism that my brain created to help me. Even though some may be scary to me, they are ultimately acting in a way that they think is best for \"me.\" I discovered that one alter, who seemed like a monster, was actually created to hold my self-doubt and anger, which is why I react to it with fear.But this alter is simply there to protect me.Just like the octopus arm that pulls away from food because it thinks it is protecting the whole octopus, my \"scary\" alter was doing the same thing, evoking the flight response in order to try to remove us from the situation.As scientists learn more about how the octopus and its suckers work (and sometimes, don’t work) together, I hope we can also gain a better understanding of how alters and DID in general can work as well.The 2020 film “The Octopus Teacher” beautifully illustrates how the entire system of the octopus operates — and sheds light on my own experience. One section of the film explains the challenges of the octopus’s arms working against each other. I couldn’t help but notice that the situation feels similar to fighting amongst my alters.Before I saw this footage, I was only able to imagine or speculate what it was like in the \"inner world\" of my mind. But right before my eyes was physical evidence of what happens, including how it feels when one alter shuts down or goes silent. It gets \"cut\" off from the rest, just like the octopus' arm did when it was attacked by the shark. But, just like the octopus, it eventually comes back and rejoins the group effort, doing its best to protect the whole being.This documentary was life-changing for me. Getting a visual representation of how my mind works is liberating, and it has given me a deeper understanding of myself and my alters.All because of an octopus.Pamela Achenbach Covert, PhD is a writer and mother to two active little boys, and she has been diagnosed with DID.

      "body": "A psychiatrist once told me that I understood my illness better than many of her patients. I took that as a compliment because I have worked hard to understand my schizoaffective disorder diagnosis and to recognize my symptoms. For example, I am now able to take a step back when I start to believe something strongly (like someone being in love with me), reflect and determine what is happening. Then, I can decide if the belief is a delusion or not. Learning to identify my delusions has been a process, but I have found a method that works for me — and I hope to share what I have learned.I keep a chart on my refrigerator of schizophrenia symptoms that I experience. This helps guide me through my feelings and beliefs, and it offers me an explanation for my emotions and actions. If I find myself believing I am an important public figure or existing in a fantasy world, I can refer to my chart to evaluate the situation. In this case, the chart tells me that this belief is a grandiose delusion (and a common one, as I’ve learned from talking to other people diagnosed with schizophrenia).If I notice that the voices in my head are distracting — causing me to forget where I’ve put things or forget what I want to say in a conversation — I can look to the chart to remember that forgetful behavior is a symptom.I also have a chart listing the symptoms of exaggerated thinking. I usually look at this list for comfort after having a traumatic delusion, like believing I am being stalked, hunted, framed or tricked. I've learned this is another one of the common manifestations of schizoaffective disorder, called persecutory delusions. I feel a little less alone when I look at the chart on my refrigerator. I even feel like my illness is “textbook schizophrenia” — a reminder that others experience this, too.Attending group therapy, where I can listen to others describe their delusions and verbalize my own delusions, has helped me to identify my delusions. While knowing medical terminology can be important, we learn the most from each other by describing our experience with a goal of understanding the unreality of a delusion.Determining as a group that delusions are not actually happening — rather, they are symptoms of schizophrenia — is a huge step in accepting our diagnosis. Group therapy has also given me tools for evaluating my symptoms when I am alone. If I hear a voice outside the door, I now know to open the front door to prove to myself that no one is there and that the voice is a delusion.Leaning on the supportive people in my life has been critical in understanding and managing delusions. My mom helps me with certain tasks, like editing my writing, when my disorganized thoughts and difficulty concentrating keep me from remembering grammar rules and syntax. She also helps me to clarify my thoughts and dig deeper to understand how a delusion makes me feel at the time I am experiencing it. Accepting that I needed this kind of help has been an important step for both my writing career and my personal growth. For those of us who have a severe mental illness diagnosis, there is no shame in asking for the help or accommodations we need.Medication has been critical to managing my symptoms. Being on the appropriate regimen makes it possible for me to recognize a symptom before I act on it. Often, my perceptions can be distorted by the schizophrenia, and I believe certain circumstances require action from me, when, in reality, they do not. For example, If I don’t receive mail for three days straight, I might be tempted to contact my mailman to see why I am not getting mail. Fortunately, medication has helped me identify these thoughts before making decisions.Moving forward, I hope to continue living a productive life in which my symptoms can’t control me. Researching and putting into practice what I learn about my diagnosis allows me to step out of myself and look inward to better explain myself to my doctor, family and friends. Being able to articulate my experience can be a relief.I will always have a deep desire to understand as much as possible about my diagnosis of schizophrenia. Knowledge gives me power over my symptoms. With information, I can be a vital contributor on my support team.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

      "body": "I was on the phone with my mentor, telling him how great I was feeling — that I had made it to the “other side” of a depressive episode that had lasted years and cost me a six-week stay in a psychiatric hospital.When I stopped chattering, my mentor said, “Be careful. Your depression could always come back.”He wasn’t being mean or trying to rain on my parade — he said it because it’s true, and he wants me to be wary.I have major depressive disorder, along with generalized anxiety disorder, persistent depressive disorder, avoidant personality disorder and binge eating disorder. None of these are easy to treat, especially my depression.I often find myself worrying about the likelihood of relapse. With major depressive disorder, I experience episodes, meaning I’m not depressed all the time. An episode is defined as a period of two weeks or more where you experience at least five symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, including a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation. (However, this is not a comprehensive list).According to the American Psychiatric Association, major depressive disorder is highly recurrent; symptoms return for at least 50% of those who recover from a first episode of depression. Approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes will have another recurrence. One study found that, on average, individuals with a history of depression will have five to nine separate episodes in their lifetimes.I’ve already had at least two depressive episodes since I was formally diagnosed at 19 years old. I’d like to think I’ll be “ready” should an episode come my way, but I panic now even if I have a bad day.“Do I need to call my psychiatrist?”\n“Maybe I should change my medications.” \n“I’m going to go on low battery mode.”And so on.I’m always walking a tight rope. Even though I feel great now — and have for months — I still have to be extremely careful. I need to get enough sleep — not too much or too little. I must take my pills at the same time, twice a day, every day, and keep up with the refills. I have to follow a healthy diet, drink tons of water and avoid any triggers, like violent or sad TV shows and books. I avoid napping during the day. I remain active. I don’t drink alcohol and try to steer clear of stressful situations. I stick to a daily routine and structure as much as I can. While these measures might seem like “normal,” responsible behavior, they are more than that — they are lifesaving. If I “break the rules,” I become emotional, impatient and irritable. I lose control of myself, and my thoughts go to a dark and negative place.This is the major challenge of having several mental health conditions; sometimes, it can feel like negative thoughts are always waiting to slip through a crack and infiltrate your mind. At first, the thoughts and symptoms can be more subtle — I stop showering as much, then I take long naps during the day. I skip a day of brushing my teeth. But once my illness has me in its grip, it can be relentless and painful. I lose hope. I isolate. I give in to the darkness, losing my grip on the tight rope.Another challenge is battling shame and self-blame. Often, I wonder, “Shouldn’t I be stronger now? Didn’t I already crawl back from the pits of hell? I have grit. I have coping skills and an amazing support system.” But I have learned to ignore that little voice in my head telling me I “should be” better or that I’m unworthy.It has been a long journey. I’ve spent the past four years working on myself, and it’s been challenging. I’ve had bad days, even horrible ones, but I’ve kept going, and now I’m living my best life. I made that happen, with the help of my support group, therapist and medication.And here I am now — voluntarily getting up at 5:00 am every morning. I take my kids to school and pick them up. I shower and brush my teeth daily. I have a column on mental health in the local newspaper, and I’m the communications manager for NAMI Greater Corpus Christi. I have found the right support, treatment and purpose.I want to help others because I felt so alone in my journey, and it literally could’ve killed me. I want to lend my voice to those who can’t use theirs.I understand that I have a mental illness, and that it’s never going away. That’s hard to accept, but even though the odds are stacked against me, I’m still betting on myself.Heather Loeb is the creator of “Unruly Neurons,” a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "As I weathered the experience of another episode, I realized how important telling my story could be.When my psychosis set in, I didn’t feel in control of my mind. Chronic stress had eroded my ability to regulate emotions and think clearly. Then, on Nov. 13, 2021, my worst symptoms began: paranoia, obsessive thoughts, compulsions and debilitating fear. Even the coping mechanisms and strategies I had worked so hard to develop could not fight these symptoms or control my psychological state. I panicked, having illogical worries about my home.Early in the morning, I rushed and packed some essential clothes in a handheld luggage bag and searched for my passport, which my wife had hidden (knowing I was struggling with my mental health). I vividly hallucinated that mental health officials assisted my wife in blocking the exit door. In reality, my wife stood in front of the door alone. In my frightened state of mind, I shoved past her. I had vividly imagined engaging in physical combat with the officers) in a battle to escape my home. I had a bizarre feeling I was involved in physically lashing out at my wife before frantically fleeing from my house and dashing out in the gloom of the street lighting, which lifted the early morning's shade of darkness. At the same time, I was driving away at an excessive speed in our car, heading toward the passport office 30 miles away before trying to leave the country.About 10 miles into the journey, the police apprehended me and asked me to park my vehicle. At the time, I had no idea my wife had called the police to report a person experiencing psychosis. I believed that the medical practitioners and the police were devious and engaged in corrupt practices. I believed I was hearing the voices of intelligent people telepathically. Ultimately, I was detained and transported to a mental health facility. This hospitalization did not give me peace of mind; I struggled to make social contact with fellow patients I can only describe as “odd balls.”My medical treatment continued until I was fully discharged in December of 2021. Although I have developed an awareness of my condition, I found it challenging to continue being psychologically resilient to live a long and healthy life. Indeed, I still I over-engage with my thoughts and emotions and get trapped in my own mind. However, I have agreed to take medication regularly.It's fair to say it has been a tough time for my brain — a journey learning how to survive and thrive. It can be a vicious circle living with a mental health condition. Yet, I feel empowered by having the agency to manage my symptoms.Schizophrenia is a complex mental health condition, but I have found my rhythm with treatment. The regimen that works best for me includes antipsychotic medication integrated with psychotherapy, practicing self-care and limiting stress. While this is not a cure, it allows me to live with minimal symptoms. In addition, I now understand how much I benefit from taking antipsychotic medications regularly, which has helped control symptoms and prevented frequent relapses. I have also found that writing about my experience empowers me and informs others about wellness and recovery.As I look to the future, I hope there's a low chance that I will continue to have episodes of psychosis relapse. But I understand every journey has setbacks; I have relapsed before and can feel deterioration over time. So, I will stick with my treatment and continue to share my story.Karl Lorenz Willett is a writer and father who has battled schizophrenia for over 40 years.

      "body": "Socialization is particularly important for the emotional well-being of people with serious mental illness (SMI). This is true for several reasons. When people maintain their connections with others, they are more likely to be tuned in to the world around them, given that social expectations require attention, commitment and concentration. For people with SMI, social interaction can stabilize mood, help them to feel grounded and connected to others and allow them to feel more engaged in their recovery process.Isolation is one of the most gut-wrenching aspects of having a mental health condition: people need support, but they may simultaneously push away support because of their symptoms. While the specific benefits of socialization for each diagnosis are unclear, the unwavering need for people with mental health conditions to develop and cultivate meaningful, supportive and organic connections is as clear as day.When my psychosis began, I was isolated, ostracized and abandoned by friends. When my symptoms became apparent, I was in my final semester of college. My friends, who had become accustomed to the person they had known for three years, were confused and alarmed. As my psychosis worsened, I became moody and paranoid — which was troubling to anyone who knew me and observed the radical changes in my thinking and behavior.For so many people with active psychosis symptoms, this is the outcome. Those dealing with psychosis may seem strange; perhaps engaging in bizarre behavior or have altered speech. People may also exhibit ill-timed and drastic changes in their disposition.This state, which can be \"scary\" or \"strange\" to some, is the point at which people experiencing psychosis need stabilization, peer connection and another organic support best cultivated by good health. The added burden of social disconnection and isolation is one reason these mental health conditions are so severe, difficult to \"bounce back\" from and dangerous. We feel increasingly isolated and misunderstood as we endure these confusing and hazardous states.My behavior years ago was so alarming to my friends that my roommate telephoned my family one evening, believing I had a plan to poison his food. As my psychosis worsened, the ability to care for myself was completely diminished. My isolation from friends, and difficulty engaging in adequate self-care, meant I had no support to lean on when I ran into issues on campus. No longer surrounded by friends, I had no one to troubleshoot what was an increasingly extensive list of problems. As a result, the issues became too overwhelming and complicated to address, given my increasing level of confusion from psychosis.People with psychosis benefit from support: the more support, the more people available to bounce ideas off of and discuss issues productively. As problems begin to mount and symptoms worsen, the need for additional support is increasingly critical. When we include others in our worldview, our perception of reality expands. The communicated experience of others contributes to the way we come to understand our world. The additional perspective is essential for people disturbed by fear and paranoia. Counsel from a friend or relative unpacking irrational beliefs is soothing and reassuring when someone is in distress from psychosis.Socialization can also be tricky for people living with affective and mood disorders. For example, trying to socialize in a manic state often leads to serious social consequences. During mania, people may appear elated, sharing grandiose ideas and speaking rapidly, all while trying to keep up with their thoughts, most of which seem more brilliant than the next.I have experienced this first-hand. I have also observed it with friends battling mood disorders; I know how difficult it is to maintain healthy connections with friends. When friends fixate on your welfare out of concern for your well-being, they spend more time watching over you than connecting with you in a meaningful way. Support from peers becomes tricky when mutual support takes a back seat to a friend in the throes of mania.Scholars must research how specific mental health symptoms can be alleviated by social interactions, kinship networks, family support and other socialized mediums enriching our lives and offering conditions supporting a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps the social landscape can be mapped out charted, and better understood by researchers evaluating support and the prognosis of people with severe mental health conditions.In doing so, research can offer clinicians working with people with severe mental health conditions recommendations and other suggestions on re-working and re-patterning their social world to best promote a healthy space for their recovery. Additionally, clinicians might be able to identify and mark protective factors more quickly and leave their patients or peers in a better position when they regain their independence.The mental health system speaks so fondly of socialization, but currently, it does little to support those engaged in the process.This is a problem for everyone involved in the recovery process. Clinicians need to provide psychoeducation to the friends and relatives of those with a diagnosis, not just the patient, to honestly expect results that will have a lasting impact on the life of those in recovery. Friends, relatives and other social connections without psychoeducation, even with good intentions, can negatively impact the recovery process or put the diagnosed person at risk of relapse or worsening symptoms. Providing recovery-focused attitudes about what to expect from someone with a specific diagnosis regarding their capacity to socialize and access social support is even more critical.Socializing is a skill set that's multifaceted and not quite as simple as telling someone to \"make a friend.\" We must teach realistic expectations and skillsets targeting specific disorders and courses of treatment to improve outcomes. Preparing all support systems with an accurate clinical picture might make the difference for those trying to move forward in their recovery.Max E.

      "body": "When I first taught NAMI’s Family-to-Family course in 2014, my co-teacher (who was a 25-year NAMI state leader and classroom teacher) introduced me to a word I’d never heard of: anosognosia. When she defined anosognosia to us, I had a revelation so powerful it practically knocked me out of my chair. The basic definition: A symptom experienced by those with serious mental illness (SMI) in which a person cannot recognize that they have a mental illness.For me, learning this term was a game-changer. I had experienced this in my own family and had been asked by others, “Why can’t my loved one believe me and their doctors and just do the right thing — take their meds, go to therapy and get better? Why can’t they see how odd their behavior is? Why do they refuse help?”I had wondered this myself. My co-teacher told us about Dr. Xavier Amador and his ground-breaking book, “I’m Not Sick, I Don’t Need Help!” I read it, and my perspective changed forever.As a peer — someone with depression, from a family with a history of depression and anxiety disorders — I have nothing medical or deeply profound to add to the body of work on the subject of anosognosia. Except this: I am convinced that a broad familiarity within our society about this condition would be life-changing for people with SMI and their families. Awareness, I believe, would encourage people to offer empathy for those struggling with SMI, as opposed to the contempt or disgust many seem to exhibit.The percentages of those with SMIs who experience anosognosia are high: 40% with bipolar disorder and, by some estimates, as high as 98% of those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.SMIs like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have their origins in a dysfunction of the frontal lobe. This is significant, as the frontal lobe is the seat of organization (or executive function) and, more importantly, self-image and self-reflection. Damage to or chemical dysfunction in the frontal lobe prevents our brains from updating our images of ourselves. Objectivity is nearly impossible, and we are unable to view our words and behavior in relation to others. The word anosognosia is actually of Greek origin, meaning without knowledge of disease or, more broadly, lack of insight.One of the most confounding aspects of anosognosia is that the degree of the lack of insight varies from person to person as well as day to day; this can result in your loved one having some level of recognition of their illness on Tuesday and zero recognition on Thursday. Hence, this hampers our ability to get them to see their doctors or therapists or take their meds as prescribed with regularity. We might see an uptick in their mental health and behavior one week, only to see them “slip back” the next.I have heard participants in more than one of my NAMI Family-to-Family classes say that their loved one is in denial about their mental illness. I always encourage people to reframe this kind of thinking. Their loved one is not “in denial.” And they’re not mean, stubborn, self-centered, or lazy. Absolutely not. One man even said he thought his son enjoyed his mental health condition because he had an excuse to stay broken and do nothing. As someone with a mental health disorder and with a grandparent, parent, and child with mental health challenges, I cannot believe that anyone would choose to stay untreated with their SMI. Let’s bring it back to anosognosia.While an understanding of anosognosia is imperative to how we view and treat someone with a serious mental illness, the flip side is a sense of enlightenment for family and caregivers, as well. There’s no need to argue or fight, as you remind yourself that this will accomplish nothing but escalate tension and animosity. Anger does not diminish the effects of anosognosia. Nor does logic. As you can’t squeeze water from a rock, you can’t force insight onto a person experiencing anosognosia.But you can benefit from insight. Self-care is an essential part of life with a family member with SMI. Save the energy you invested in arguing with your loved one and channel it into self-kindness. NAMI reminds us:Give yourself a break from the frustration and disappointment of your inability to communicate with your loved one about their illness.When I talk with someone about a loved one with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, I always ask if they are familiar with anosognosia. Sadly, all of the people I have asked have replied, “no.” The look of revelation, compassion and empathy on their faces after an explanation is a rewarding moment for me every time.This has led me to wonder: Why aren’t practitioners explaining anosognosia to families? How much kinder, more compassionate and more patient would we be with our loved ones if we understood that their brains can't process the fact that their perception doesn’t reflect reality?So if someone in your family — or even a close friend, neighbor, or co-worker — has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, openly discuss anosognosia with them, if they are comfortable. In fact, discuss it with anyone when the subject of mental illness comes up in conversation. Talk about it with someone whose loved one is non-compliant with their medication regimen or is refusing entry into a treatment facility. An understanding that the person is not in denial, stubborn or apathetic about their circumstances can lift a heavy weight off their shoulders. Use your personal skills and strengths to broaden awareness and generate compassion for those who, through no fault of their own, run from the outstretched hand of help.As I address in the book I co-wrote with Dr. Terri Lyon, “Make a Difference with Mental Health Activism,” we can’t underestimate the wide-reaching impacts of personal activism, particularly in areas of mental health. Activism boosts emotional well-being and is a critical step toward ending stigma, achieving parity and increasing mental health services and support.

      "body": "Recently, I wrote a book about the challenges and stresses of mothering adult children. I began my research in senior centers in the New York City area and gave members of these centers a short talk about my project. I asked who in the audience was a parent — and I inquired about the parenting problems they encountered when their children were one year old, three years old and 15 years old. The audience laughed and shouted out various issues like teething and sleep (for babies and toddlers) and drugs or problems in school (for adolescents).I then asked what kinds of problems their 30 or 40-year-old kids faced. The audience became silent. One or two said “depression,” “drug problems” and “unemployment.” I then explained that I was doing a research study that hoped to understand the kinds of problems mothers have experienced with their adult children. At each site, a few women came forward. I arranged a time to interview them privately.All the women in my study were over 55 years old. I purposely included women who were from all income groups (low-income, middle-class and affluent) and lived in in various parts of the country. I met with each woman two times, conducting in-depth interviews. My focus was on what issues had emerged in their adult child’s life and how these problems had affected them. I quickly realized that these mothers’ experiences and challenges centered around caring for their children who developed serious mental illness (SMI) in adulthood.I learned that the women were dealing with more than one problem. For example, Durene, who was 72 years old, told me about her son’s mental health diagnosis 17 years ago. He had gone off to college, but in his second year, he experienced a psychotic episode. Durene had to bring him home from school — and he has been living with her since. She described how life is a strain on a daily basis. He’s “selfish,” she said, and they have fights over keeping the kitchen clean.On two occasions, her son pulled a knife on her, and she called the police. Her friends advised her to “put him out.” But she told me that she was not going to listen to them. She feared more for her son’s safety. “He will not survive; he will not survive,” she repeated. Durene firmly believed that if she followed her friends’ advice and evicted her son from her home, he would not be able to live on the streets of New York City, homeless.A main theme that I heard expressed was the women’s sense of shame and self-blame for their adult children’s problems. “I was a working mother.” “My husband was abusive, and they witnessed that.” “I was a single mom.” And this shame may explain why many of them were living in secret, afraid to share even with family the problems they were having in their own homes with their now adult children. They felt alone and increasingly isolated.Even though I had not set out to study mothers whose adult children had serious mental illness, to my surprise, nearly all the research subjects’ adult children had problems with serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Their children had all returned home because they could no longer work and had no place to live. Each of the women re-opened their homes. A few had sufficient resources to house them in a separate residence. Many had situations like Durene’s, in which they felt their space was being invaded, and they did not know who to turn to for assistance. “If not me, who?” was what I heard from so many about their feelings of responsibility regarding their adult children’s safety.Another woman I interviewed, Jillian, described that she felt like a mule, attached to a cart, and she couldn’t disconnect. The cart was her daughter’s illness and the need to make sure her child had a place to live and food to eat. Jillian had moved her daughter 21 times in 20 years. As a result of the stress, she hated each time the phone rang, fearing it was the police or the landlord. She developed ulcers and described feeling like she was “bleeding inside.”Through these interviews, I learned just how much the women’s decision-making was influenced by a deep internalized wish to be “a good mother.” When women were faced with calling the police or evicting their adult children who were putting their lives at risk, so many told me in different words, “That is not what a mother does.” These mothers wanted their adult children to get help — not to go to jail or be homeless. They felt trapped by the lack of available help and by their inability to turn away from their role as a mother, despite their own advanced years.When I started interviewing moms who had been through the NAMI Family-to-Family Program, I heard much less self-blame. Each of the NAMI mothers described an enormous feeling of relief after attending their first NAMI group; suddenly, they no longer felt alone. Learning about their adult child’s situation as an illness or serious medical condition allowed them to see that they were not necessarily the “cause” of their children’s mental illness and resulting challenges.The NAMI Family-to-Family program also offered avenues for women to feel empowered to use their energy to help others.

      "body": "25 years ago, I packed my two young children and cedar chest into the back of my truck. We were westbound from Colorado Springs to Medford, Oregon, looking for a new life away from abuse. We started over in the safety of a duplex behind my brother’s house. He and my sister-in-law had secured the nice, humble home for us while I was still making my escape plans on the other side of the Rockies.I had the perfect job transfer working for Mayflower transit. My daughter was enrolled in the same school I went to at her age and my son went to a good daycare. Things seemed like they were all going to work out, and we would have the perfect American dream, if just I worked hard enough.One morning, my brother called and told me that my beloved grandfather had suffered a heart attack. I remember falling to my knees and screaming. The strawberry cake I had been frosting for my daughter’s second grade class fell to the floor, coming apart all over the tiles. It seemed like a metaphor for my crumbling life.This was the last traumatic event in my life that my mind could handle, and it marked the beginning of my first bipolar episode. It would not be my last, by far. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar I at the age of 30. I thought I had escaped my marriage with my sanity, but at that point, my sanity felt so far gone.It wasn’t long after the funeral that I was admitted to the hospital. I was traumatized and manic —and I began experiencing psychosis.My family tried to help with the children, and my mother even flew out from Arizona to stay with them for the first month that I was in and out of the hospital. She took care of me after I was released, which was no small task. I was so thin. I remember her making me peanut butter milkshakes to eat with my morning pills.I soon spiraled into another mania despite all my mother’s heroic attempts to save me.I remember galloping my horse Nick down the road, dodging traffic and yelling at the top of my lungs. I believed the whole world was watching me, as if I were on a live broadcast. By this time, my mother needed to go back to Arizona. She could not handle my manic energy any longer — it became too much to manage in addition to caring for my precious children, who were now scared to death. They had never known me not to protect them.I tried so hard to take care of my kids with other family support. My younger brother stepped in and had me readmitted to a mental health facility. He was able to convince me to hand over my babies to my other brother and sister-in-law, promising they would be fine.When I left to be hospitalized, my son, who was only a toddler at the time, was terrified. My daughter was stood nearby, sobbing. My heart was so broken.I remember the drive to the hospital. I panicked and tried to jump out of my brother’s Volkswagen van. He quickly reached over and shut the passenger door. I punched him in the jaw with a solid right. But somehow, he managed to coax me into the emergency room again.At this point, I was hallucinating and so scared that I had to be put in restraints. I was immediately taken to the psychiatric ward. I was held in solitary confinement with a big metal door locked behind me. The windowless room felt like a cold dungeon.When I woke up in the morning after being tranquilized so heavily, all I could think about was my children, and how they must be needing me right now. Even though I knew my family had stepped in to care for them, I could only think of them wondering where their mother was, especially after the unsettling drama the night before.I remained manic for several days in the hospital. Once they let me out of solitary confinement, I was introduced to the community group room, where I very slowly adapted to stimuli again. I remember only being allowed to sit by the fish tank. I would watch a bug-eyed black fish for a while and feel some level of relaxation before being brought back to my little quarantine room below. I could not handle too much activity at this time in my treatment program; I was extremely sensitive and fragile. I finally stabilized enough to go home.After the manic phase, and my release from the hospital, came a wave of depression. There are no words to describe the depth of despair I plunged into. One day, I knocked out half the power of Medford by ramming my truck into a utility pole. Transformers crashed down all around my truck. Later that day, I made an attempt on my life, leaving scars behind.Following this series of events, my children went back to their father’s home in Colorado, as he was able to prove I was not fit to care for them. My children struggled to adapt to their new situation for much of their childhoods.My mental health journey has been a scary and challenging road for my family, especially my children. They are scarred but resilient. I’m so grateful for them. They have been so forgiving of both their father and me.Ultimately, I’ve learned that hope walks with the hurting. I held onto my faith, and I spent a lot of time praying, with tears flowing down my face. Despite the ups and downs, I am determined to survive the coming storms.Randi Barnum is an enthusiast of life and all that may come with it.

      "body": "“Find something to represent her and put an item in your office so that she feels accepted,” My therapist said. She shared this advice with me while I was working on healing from dissociative identity disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder. The “she” my therapist was referring to was one of my altered states (also known as alters/parts).I could not believe that this had become my life — talking to my therapist about my different alters/parts and ways to help them, love them, learn about them, write to them and attune to their needs. It was like taking care of a large family inside myself. It was the ultimate lesson in parenting, the reparenting of myself, all of me. It was also exhausting, sad, irritating, disappointing and incredibly painful.Though the journey has not been easy, having reached a solid understanding of who I am in addition to coming forward with my lived experience has brought me a profound sense of peace and emotional freedom.It was a costly journey — both financially and emotionally — and absolutely worth every dollar spent and every tear shed.Now, I’m hoping to give back by sharing my experience and helping others in their recovery.There were times I thought about giving up on my healing journey, but my heart knew that I could not. So I put one foot in front of the other, took things one day at a time and held on tightly to myself and to my faith.For me, coping meant keeping up with therapy, consulting with my mentors and attending trauma-healing intensive workshops, soul workshops, women's groups and bodywork. It meant letting my husband show up for all parts of me and asking for help, encouragement and support as I navigated the healing journey. It required building a network of healers and strengthening my internal and external resources as I leaned in and surrendered to fully trusting the process.The healing process presented many challenges, like getting to a place of loving all my identities and accepting that they were all me. It also required fully confronting my past. When I was able to accept what happened to me, the diagnosis itself and the impact DID has had on my life and relationships — things started to change. I allowed myself time to grieve the reality of my childhood and finally let out my tears and feelings. It was a process and the transformation did not happen overnight.After years of effort, I reached a place of internal trust and cooperation. I was ready to live. I was happy, healthy, connected, loved and respected. Most importantly, I loved and respected myself.I never intended to speak about my lived experience. I had never even planned to disclose my diagnosis to any family or friends. My plan was simply to heal and forget about it. But then I found my voice and began to embrace my experience and diagnosis.I wanted to encourage others to keep going, to hold on, to work toward recovery and to have hope. My purpose became clear: I wanted to help others. I wanted to work serve my community through public advocacy, speaking, educating, consulting, writing and my work as a psychologist because I could understand the perspective of both therapist and client. Through this work, I hoped to change how DID is perceived.I respect that a public disclosure of a highly stigmatized and debated condition like DID is not for everyone, nor is it always safe depending on a person’s circumstances. For me, it required deep thought, consideration, time, consultation and a solid place in my recovery.For those who have reached a point in their recovery where they can tell their story in a safe and empowering way, I recommend taking time to share your experience with others.I want my story to change the negative and inaccurate narratives surrounding this mental health condition and to instill a sense of hope.A diagnosis does not define me, nor does it define anyone else. I am a human being who has endured extreme trauma. I am no monster, and I am not dangerous. My favorite cartoon as a little girl was Care Bears, and I can tell you with certainty that I am a cheerful person with a tender heart. I want the best for people. I genuinely believe others deserve to love themselves and to get to a place of self-love and self-acceptance.As Brenè Brown says, and one of my therapists used to reiterate to me all the time, “Love will never be certain, but after collecting thousands of stories, I am willing to call this a fact: A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all men, women and children. We are biologically, cognitively, physically and spiritually wired to love, to be loved and to belong.”I have come to view having DID as a gift. I would not have survived without it. Of course, I made mistakes. I let people down. I missed a lot. The journey to get here was not perfect and recovery was not and will never be perfect. Healing will be lifelong, because as a human being I am constantly growing, adapting and learning. But this process has taught me that I wanted more for myself and for others than to just live-in survival mode. I wanted to thrive.“I believe we are here on the planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we can to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy freedom.” – Rosa ParksAdrian Fletcher, Psy.D. is a human first, therapist second.

      "body": "An estimated 7 million adults in the U.S. live with bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that causes dramatic shifts in a person’s mood, energy and ability to think clearly. Its effects can be disabling; an estimated 83% of people with bipolar disorder had serious impairment, the highest rate among mood disorders. Bipolar disorder is also highly stigmatized, resulting in the spread of misinformation and misconceptions about the condition.On my journey to recovery from bipolar disorder, I have encountered the condition’s challenges, as well as society’s misperceptions. I have encountered people who believe that all that people with bipolar disorder enjoy manic episodes. I have seen other people who believed mania was an amusing spectacle; instead of helping people during a manic episode, they might stare or laugh, even encouraging the dangerous behaviors. And I have experienced just how harmful the manic and depressive episodes can be.But I have also learned that it is possible to live in recovery. And, with the right information, we can fight the stigma and help the people we know who live with bipolar disorder.There are several types of bipolar disorder to be aware of. Bipolar I and II are the most common types; People with bipolar I experience mania while people with bipolar II experience a milder form of mania called hypomania. Less common is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, which is, as the name suggests, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar. This comorbidity (the presence of two conditions) is common with bipolar disorder. Over 50% of people with bipolar I and II experience anxiety, and 48% and 61% engage in substance use, respectively. Often, people will choose to self-medicate with substance use — and this can trigger other symptoms.For bipolar I and II, people experience phases of illness; the main phases are the highs of hypomania/mania and the lows of major depression.Some common symptoms of hypomania/mania include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness and goal-directed activity, racing thoughts and engaging in activities with potentially damaging consequences. Hypomania may not appear to interfere with everyday functioning, and some people may even enjoy being hypomanic, so they may resist treatment during this phase. But both forms of mania can have serious consequences. In addition to hospitalizations, criminal offending and arrests, this symptom can significantly harm people and their relationships.It’s also important to be able to identify a depressive episode; common symptoms of depression for people with bipolar I and II include low mood, loss of interest in activities, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty thinking or concentrating and recurrent suicidal ideation.Some people may also experience a “mixed state” that combines the features of mania and depression.Approximately 53% of people with bipolar I can experience psychosis, in which a person loses touch with reality, often experiencing hallucinations and delusions. An estimated 40% of people with bipolar experience anosognosia or lack of awareness of symptoms. People with bipolar disorder also face high rates of suicide that exceed those of other major psychiatric disorders — up to 19% die by suicide and up to 50% will make a non-fatal suicide attempt.When learning about bipolar disorder, it’s important to understand the basics.Risk Factors: Having a close relative with bipolar disorder, experiencing stressful life events and having a history of substance abuse are all risk factors for bipolar disorder.Onset: The average age of onset is 25 years old, but symptoms also appear in the teen years.Diagnosis: To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at least one episode of hypomania/mania. Getting a correct diagnosis can take time. Many with bipolar are misdiagnosed with either unipolar depression, which often precedes a manic episode, schizophrenia if the person experiences psychosis or borderline personality disorder if they experience rapid mood cycling.Treatment: It is important for those experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder to receive a diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Without it, the condition may worsen and become harder to treat. Some people are initially prescribed anti-depressants for unipolar depression, which have not been shown effective to treat bipolar depression and may trigger a manic episode. Further, substance use may complicate the treatment of bipolar disorder.Medication: There are many medication options for treating bipolar disorder. Typically, patients are prescribed lithium and some anticonvulsants, which can help stabilize mood. They may also be given antipsychotics that mostly treat mania (although few treat depression as well). Antidepressants are also included in many courses of treatment. It is important to ask about common side effects before taking a medication; side effects are a common reason for non-adherence to a medication regimen, which is the leading risk of relapse.Therapy: Effective types of therapy include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family-Focused Therapy (FFT) and Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT). CBT seeks to change thinking and behavioral patterns that target problem areas. FFT involves psychoeducation, communication enhancement training and problem-solving skills training. IPSRT helps people improve medication adherence, manage stressful life events and reduce disruptions in “social rhythms” or patterns of daily habits.While bipolar disorder can be incredibly harmful if untreated, it can also be accompanied by “positive” attributes, which are a source of pride for many people.A leading bipolar scholar identified numerous extremely well-known poets, writers, composers and painters who lived or are living with bipolar disorder, including Vincent Van Gogh, Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway. In her 1996 book “Touched with Fire,” she argues that the instability of mood and temperament characteristic of bipolar are integral to their productivity and originality.People with bipolar disorder are also over-represented among highly successful entrepreneurs. The symptoms and traits of bipolar have been associated with high IQ and perseverance on difficult tasks. Other positive attributes exhibited during a hypomanic state, which may favor entrepreneurial activities,  include high energy levels, extroversion, self-esteem and optimism.Ultimately, bipolar disorder is complex. It is not easy to treat, nor is it easy to live with. In fact, it may take many years to learn how to manage it, as it did for me. I reached recovery thanks to great treatment and a supportive family, but most of all because of me. Once I realized that I could manage my symptoms, I took responsibility for my illness and did everything I could to get and stay well.I would like to thank Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a leading mood disorders psychiatrist specializing in bipolar, for being my wonderful doctor and for taking the time to review this blog post.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder after first being diagnosed over 20 years ago.

      "body": "When I was in my teens, I started experiencing symptoms of depression. Unfortunately, my family didn’t know much about mental illness or what symptoms to look for. So, every time I couldn’t get out of bed – sometimes for days or longer – they’d say, “looks like Barb has mono again!”Only after a major episode in my freshman year of college did I seek and get the help I needed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, began therapy and started a medication to help my symptoms. For so many reasons, this was a relief. Not only was I starting to feel better, but I had a name to put to what was happening to me.Over the next few years, I got used to my condition and became more and more open about it. The world was changing when it came to talking about mental health — and talking about having depression, going to therapy ­­and taking medication wasn’t a big deal to me.When I was 22, things changed. One day, I woke up with more energy than I’d ever had. I went to work, but couldn’t sit still, and I left at lunch. I felt an uncontrollable need to keep moving, and the first thing I did was go shopping. I grabbed clothes I’d never normally wear — or afford — and impulsively bought them. Then, I had the thought that I really needed to plant a garden in my front lawn, so immediately went and bought a carload of flowers and soil and ran back home to plant.I spent hours doing this, without regard to anything else — work, food, my roommate. I was simply no longer in control of my body. The next couple of days, I continued this trend. I didn’t sleep much, I talked nonstop, I cleaned our apartment obsessively. Finally, I crashed hard, falling into a deep depression that prompted me to call my psychiatrist at the time.After I explained what had happened, she told me it sounded like a hypomanic episode, potentially a sign of bipolar disorder type II, and she recommended I try a new medication. For some reason, this diagnosis was a heck of a lot scarier than my depression diagnosis. This one made me feel like I was “crazy.” Movies and other media often show people with bipolar disorder as unpredictable, even dangerous. I, on the other hand, felt I “had things together.” I had a great job, was in a loving relationship, got along great with my friends. And I certainly didn’t feel dangerous.Over time, I learned more about bipolar, what it was and wasn’t, how I could live well with it. And I trusted my doctor and therapist, who both helped me learn to cope with new symptoms. I still “had it together.” However, whenever I shared that I had a mental health condition with another person, I was truthful about depression, but I conveniently did not mention the bipolar II. And things went well, for a while.Unfortunately, my symptoms came back, and I had another hypomanic episode. My doctor and I discussed how there might be other kinds of medications that could help me. I was open to it. But when I looked up my new medication, I learned it was classified as an “antipsychotic.” What? I thought. Was I now a villain in a scary movie? While I did not actually experience psychosis, the medication happens to work for other symptoms I was experiencing as well. So, I decided to take it — and it really, really helped.But like so many other people, I was spooked by the label. I repeatedly tried to stop taking the medication (with my doctor’s knowledge but against his advice) and each time the depression piece of my bipolar II came back with a vengeance. Finally, I acknowledged that the medication was the right thing for me.Stigma is powerful, so powerful that it made me fall into multiple, avoidable depressions. So powerful that I was ashamed to tell my partner or family what medications I took. I believe that words matter, and I think many people, at least in my community, are ready to hear the words “anti-depressant” or “anti-anxiety.” But “antipsychotic” smacked a label on me that, unfortunately, is not universally accepted yet.It was only with knowledge that I became more comfortable with both my condition and my treatment. I occasionally started mentioning that I had bipolar II with some of my friends when I was struggling, some of whom were curious about the condition, but all of whom were supportive. But it took me a lot longer before I could start sharing that I took an antipsychotic medication to treat it, and to this day I wonder if it frightens people when I tell them.I know that the more I share, the more I demonstrate that it’s ok to have a serious mental health condition, the better the process will be for the next person diagnosed with this common, treatable condition. While I no longer take the antipsychotic for other medical reasons, I have learned through the process not to let a label define me. If you’re experiencing something like this, I hope you won’t let it define you, either.Barb Solish is the Director of NAMI’s Youth and Young Adult Initiatives.

      "body": "Those of us who have experienced psychosis will tell you: we can be overly hard on ourselves after an episode. After a mental health crisis, it can be easy to blame yourself and lose yourself in shame. But over time, I’ve learned that self-blame isn’t the answer — self-love is. Choosing to love yourself can serve as a road map out of darkness and into a bright future.My journey to healing was a long one. After each hospitalization for psychosis, I woke up every morning feeling defeated and like my life was over — or it should have been. I had no assurance — no confirmation — that my life as I knew it would ever return and move forward. I just had to force myself to put one foot in front of the other, believing it was possible for me to heal.My mental health journey would have been much easier if I had been able to see my future; to know that my life would turn around and that I would secure a full-time job, and, a year later, I would land a career position. It would have been all the motivation in the world to already know that in five years I would marry the wonderful man I love in the presence of family members who stuck by me and good friends, some old and some new. It would have been pure joy to know that in seven years I would give birth and become a mother.However, we do not get to glimpse our futures. And in those early months and years, all I could see in front of me were disability papers, medication and a diagnosis, not to mention debilitating emotional pain and cognitive damage. During my hospitalizations, I often felt like the mountain before me was too formidable to climb. But something in me wouldn’t allow me to give up — and I’m thankful for that. My favorite quote by Dr. Martin Luther King is, “Faith is taking the first step even when you can’t see the whole staircase.”I had to trust I was moving in the right direction without having everything figured out. But to take those first steps, I had to believe that I was still alive for a reason. I had to know that I matter. I had to love myself enough to want good things to happen in my life.Loving yourself can take many forms: The initiative to first seek treatment and then the persistence to stick with it. The tenacity to find the answers you are looking for and find the right doctor. The infinite patience you must have while your brain heals. The ability to realize that your illness is a medical condition, not a character flaw. The grace to know that you can still enjoy life even if you are not completely healed yet, and the faith that one day you will be. The confidence to accept you may need to take medication for life. The boldness to make the best decisions for you, no matter what anyone else thinks about mental illness. The recognition, acceptance and appreciation of moments when others love you, and are cheering you on, because feeling loved and supported also helps so much with having the motivation and courage to recover.You can still have love for yourself, even if you have competing feelings like shame, anger and sadness. Even though it has been 10 years since my last psychotic break, I still blame and shame myself sometimes for having had psychosis, as part of a mental health diagnosis so stigmatized by society. I struggle sometimes with being kind and forgiving to myself, even though I know I did nothing wrong by having mental illness.It would be so misleading to state that any of this is easy. Coming to terms with how I feel about what I went through is still an ongoing battle for me, but I’m winning because love always seems to win in the end. I have found this to be true in my story, and I think love can win in your life too.I once thought that the worst thing in the world was to lose your mind, but it isn’t. The condition of your heart matters more. The ability to choose love is the one thing that can never be taken away from you.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "I was scrolling through TikTok the other night, as many Gen Z-ers do, and I came across a woman my age talking about trigger warnings. For those unfamiliar, Merriam-Webster defines a “trigger warning” as “a statement of caution that content may be disturbing or upsetting.” This woman was mocking those providing trigger warnings before their videos, arguing that trigger warnings are useless, that the world cannot and will not “shelter you,” and that the only one who cares about what you are going through is yourself.I found this message to be incredibly toxic and harmful. As someone with mental illness, I was upset to see someone with an online platform telling her audience that “no one cares.” As many of us living with mental health conditions will tell you, mental illness often tells us just that; that we are worthless, alone and a burden.Although I struggle with my mental health, I am fortunate to have resources and a support system to turn to. Not everyone does. And not everyone viewing this woman’s video will question her thinking. Instead, they will internalize her words and believe they cannot turn to anyone. Often, those living with mental illness will suffer alone to avoid burdening others. While a friend cannot provide the same level of support as a mental health professional, they can remind you that you are loved, you are worthy and you matter.When people with influence demean trigger warnings, they perpetuate a harmful line of thinking that ignores the lived experiences of so many people.Trigger warnings have been a topic of debate for years. They are a controversial subject, especially in the academic sphere. Professors and teachers have largely adopted disclaimer language, providing warnings of the content discussed in semesters on their syllabuses or before classes. In my senior year of college, my creative writing professor required my classmates and I to put trigger warnings before our short stories if the work discussed traumatic events. Similarly, mental health events I have attended included resources and a disclaimer at the beginning that difficult subjects may arise.Those against trigger warnings argue that they are coddling people and simply don’t help. Or, like this woman on TikTok, they might say that that trigger warnings are making the younger generation too sensitive. However, there isn’t enough data to conclude whether these disclaimers do or don’t work yet. But, regardless of efficacy, is that the point? Perhaps we could see trigger warnings as giving students or individuals the choice to decide for themselves what they can handle.Certainly, this TikTokker isn’t completely wrong. Society does not always care. The world can be a hard place, and mental illness is still very much stigmatized. I do not expect the world to “baby” me, but is that what trigger warnings are about? I don’t believe so.When a social media influencer or professor or a television show alerts me: “trigger warning,” I feel respected. I feel seen; as if someone is telling me, “I know what you have been through, and it is ok if right now you do not want to go back there.”Trigger warnings give people autonomy. They allow people to compose themselves, to enter a healthier mindset or simply to decide, “I cannot handle this today.” After all, trauma is very real — and people’s  reactions to their life experiences are valid and do not require the approval of other people. Trigger warnings, as I understand them, are an act of compassion, not a sign of a weak generation. Because one of the strongest things you can do is ask for help or admit, “I am not ok.” Trigger warnings say, “Not everyone will care, but I do. I care.”Meghan Nelligan is a creative writer and mental health advocate based in New Jersey.

      "body": "Far too many film depictions of mental health facilities suggest that inpatient stays are terrifying or abusive. As you may recall from the 1975 movie \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest,\" a practitioner performs lobotomies on patients.While these negative depictions may have been more realistic in the past, they do not reflect the current experience of an inpatient stay at a mental health facility.Given these negative depictions, I was nervous when I was admitted to inpatient care. I had no idea what to expect, and I feared for the worst. For anyone who may be considering an inpatient stay, I want to share what I’ve learned about the process in hopes of giving you the information I once needed.The facility where you receive treatment may not be the one closest to where you live. Initially, I couldn't understand why I went into an inpatient treatment center so far from home. However, when I began to work at emergency services, and was the one tasked with calling for open beds for patients, I came to understand how the system works.Treatment location often comes down to availability, which can be very limited. Therefore, we can't pick our inpatient stays like we would a hotel, and it might not be the most convenient. With that said, it's important to remember that what matters most is receiving proper treatment and getting healthy.During the intake process, you will likely meet several providers, including a therapist/social worker, psychiatrist and nurses. These providers will walk you through the following steps:Throughout your stay, you will have a therapist (or social worker) and psychiatrist assigned to work with you. Keep in mind that if you have been admitted during the weekend or on holidays, you will be given a temporary psychiatrist and may not see your therapist until a regular workday.More often than not, you will share a room with another individual. Most inpatient centers don't have many single rooms, which can feel uncomfortable for some. However, many enjoy the company and conversation with peers.It’s usually best to avoid isolating yourself in your room, but, of course, the room can also be a haven when you need space, time for yourself and quiet. Even if you do have a roommate, you will likely have some time alone in your room.Mental health counselors often do a frequent headcount to ensure everyone's location and safety throughout the day. Staff will continue this process throughout the night. Naturally, you may not be thrilled about this frequent monitoring — but try to remember that your providers are simply looking out for you in the best way they can.All inpatient centers run differently, but they do have set regimens.Inpatient stays do not look like the hospitalizations of decades past, where individuals stayed for months or years. Historically, mental health resources were not available in the “outside world,” so individuals were either hospitalized for long periods or released to fend for themselves. However, in the current mental health landscape, we have more resources than ever before. As a result, inpatient stays are typically short-lived, and patients receive follow-up outpatient care.Unfortunately, due to the volume of patients, the treatment teams at inpatient facilities do not have the time that a personal therapist or psychiatrist has with each patient. This coupled with the fact that insurance companies cover a limited stay per client, means that you will be encouraged to move to outpatient care quickly.Accordingly, your therapist may prioritize case management rather than counseling, and they will find the appropriate services for you, like an outside therapist or prescriber if you don't have one. They might also recommend a partial-hospitalization, a day group program that teaches coping skills and can last between days to several weeks. Inpatient psychiatrists also have a minimal time window, so they will likely prioritize immediate stabilization over creating a long-term treatment regimen to ensure you are safe before discharge.Of course, being hospitalized may not sound ideal. And it certainly isn’t a fun vacation. But it can be a life-saving and enriching experience. Inpatient care can help stabilize you and provide you with resources you might not have known about. Ultimately, this kind of care saved my life. And I hope for others to have a similar experience.Sandy Glover is a mental health advocate with degrees in psychology and mental health counseling.

      "body": "Growing up, I was a studious, perfectionist go-getter. Even in my earliest memories, I was focused on getting the perfect grades, behaving perfectly and even eating perfectly. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I reasoned that all I had to do was focus on getting into a good college with a scholarship — and then my life would unfold without too many hiccups.That was my approach for the first eighteen years of my life. I managed to get a college scholarship in seventh grade, I took all of the AP classes my school offered, I played sports, ran clubs, volunteered and became valedictorian of my high school. I got into an “elite” private college with everything paid for. I figured I was set.Soon everything collapsed.In my second semester of college, I experienced a manic episode and psychosis with no warning or apparent cause. For a week, I slept for half an hour each night. I barely ate. I spent all my time working on my art (I was a fine arts major focusing on traditional printmaking). I began to think I could fly and was close to seriously injuring myself multiple times. My mind raced constantly, and my body never seemed to slow down. Worst of all, I had no awareness of anything being amiss. I didn’t question whether anything was “off.” I didn’t know that my life was about to change.What comes up must come down. I slept for 22 hours straight and woke up feeling depressed and suicidal. I started planning my death. Thankfully, I managed to ask for help. I went to the college’s counseling center and spoke up. After my confession, I found myself in the psychiatric hospital, where I stayed for a few months.While in treatment, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). Ultimately, I experience depression, mania, delusions and auditory hallucinations.In the decade since that diagnosis, I’ve spent my time trying to get well. It has been an unpredictable journey, with plenty of setbacks. Hospitalizations. Suicide attempts. Medication changes. Psychotic episodes. Sexual assault. Therapists. Doctors. Electroconvulsive shock therapy. Chronic illness. Life.For each of these setbacks, I’ve also made progress in my recovery and come to understand the complex reality of adulthood.Often, I reminisce on what it was like to feel mentally “healthy” — the way I was during my childhood. It’s become almost impossible for me to remember clearly, but I dream of it, and I crave it. I wonder where I’d be now if I didn’t have this illness. I wonder if I’d have a degree, a steady job, my own home and the courage to drive a car. I think about how I could have missed all the traumatic experiences I had in the hospitals: involuntary stays, sexual assault, loss of privacy, loss of contact with the outside world.Sometimes, I think back and remember how easy everyday things used to be — and it’s heartbreaking. I know my illness isn’t my fault (and that it runs in my family) but sometimes I wonder if I could go back in time and prevent it. But I also wonder if I would actually make that choice. I am not my mental illness — but it has certainly carved me out. My mental health condition has affected every aspect of my life any many aspects of my family and friends’ lives. It has informed who I am today and who I’ll be tomorrow.It’s easy to say, “you shouldn't have regrets” or, “your struggles have made you stronger.” But it’s also ok to grieve the life you thought you’d live.It’s ok to grieve the dreams that didn’t become reality. It’s ok to grieve the achievements that weren’t awarded. It’s ok to grieve the happiness, peace and stability that you have desperately sought out. It’s ok to grieve the money you spent. It’s ok to grieve while thinking back to the impulsive or embarrassing decisions you made when you weren’t yourself. It’s ok to grieve knowing your struggles may have taken things away from you.I’m allowing myself to grieve these things. I’m trying to be easier on myself — to fight my perfectionism and the voice in the back of my mind that says that my illnesses are stopping me from doing all the things I desire.I’m finally allowing myself to be proud of the small things I manage on the roughest of days. I’m allowing myself to be proud of the days when I push thoughts of self-harm away. For when I speak up and share my struggles. For when I call my therapist instead of hiding away from the world. When I simply get out of bed.I think we all could use a little more self-compassion, couldn’t we?Josey is a professional oil painter and printmaker, a yoga teacher and an aspiring writer.

      "body": "“Once an Arab woman taints her reputation, she cannot be redeemed.”Those are the words I came to understand intimately in my childhood. The demands of purity and a good reputation still influence countless Middle Eastern women to hide their pain and need for assistance.The social rules governing Middle Eastern families may be as different as their migration stories, but the themes are the same: purity, honor, graciousness are all characteristics are paramount for women. The reputation of the family depends on it — and the needs of the family unit outweighs the well-being of its members.For generations, a family’s “good” reputation was tied to their survival and social standing in their homelands. Although these cultural norms are deeply rooted, they are no longer a necessity for survival for immigrants living thousands of miles away. But too often, these norms prevail, and Middle Eastern family members suffer in silence.Nicole Vowell, a 35-year-old Palestinian, Irish woman was raised in a Christian-Palestinian family. They migrated to America as refugees in 1956, and settled in Michigan, where they live today. I was raised in a Muslim-Palestinian family that moved from Kuwait to Texas when I was almost seven.Vowell and I were raised with issues unique to our families. But we were both taught that these issues at home were private and not spoken of publicly. If we were yelled at or belittled, it’s because we deserved it. If we showed symptoms of depression, we were shamed and even called “lazy.” If we held boundaries or asserted our own needs, we were punished for being disrespectful.We both come from good families, and regardless of the mental struggles we experienced, our families loved us — and “one does not turn their back on their family,” we were told. As children, we accepted this and protected our family reputations, covering any faults, mistakes or vulnerabilities.Experiencing mental illness as a woman in the Middle Eastern American community is a matter that remains shrouded in stigma and shame.According to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 3.7 million Americans claim Arab ancestry, but data on Arab Americans’ health, including mental illness, is missing because they are not identified as an ethnic group. This has led to an inability to provide for their medical and psychological needs.“Arab Americans are in an unusual position in the American health care system — they are a group that both exists in the public consciousness, but is also un-counted, and hence has not been a part of a national reckoning with its needs and particularities,” according to a literature review about the health of Arab Americans in the U.S.Anecdotally, mental illness is common in the Middle East. But if an individual suffering from abuse, toxic environments or struggling with symptoms of mental illness, they are unlikely to report or seek help. This can be explained by the desire to protect family reputation and address issues privately. Indeed, the extended family in Arab culture is at the core of social support, and it is the extended family’s job to resolve abuse or domestic violence. In fact, family members could even be ostracized for seeking formal services — because seeking help publicly is interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the family structure.The concept of psychological health in Middle Eastern culture is constructed through misinformation, a reliance on stereotypes and exaggerated media reports, according to research published at the University of California, Davis. This stigma can only be addressed through comprehensive mental health education and the prioritization of culturally responsive medical and psychological facilities.The attitudes and misinformation often migrate with families to the U.S. In my Palestinian family, an uncle with a history of family trauma died alone in an alley after overdosing one night. His siblings tried to get him help for drug abuse, but it was too late. They did not acknowledge the trauma and mental health issues that led him to use.Vowell believes her mother is unstable because she suffered sexual trauma when she was growing up at the hands of someone in her extended family. No one truly knows the details of her abuse or speaks of it. Vowell’s mother refuses to see a therapist to this day.Vowell grew up to become an award-winning broadcast journalist and later, a communications director. She also mentors women transitioning from careers in TV news to communications.Behind the scenes, however, Vowell has also been working through PTSD, depression, anxiety and ADHD diagnoses, she said. She has been going to therapy since she was 13 years old and became consistent about her healing in the last two and a half years.I moved to Jordan in 2017 and created the independence I once thought to be impossible. My parents initially disowned me but later came to understand the damage that caused. After three years, I moved to California where I worked as a newspaper reporter covering education, the achievement gap and childhood trauma. However, I felt lost, restless and directionless. I returned to therapy and was diagnosed with anxiety and symptoms of depression.Like Vowell and I, other Middle Eastern, millennial women “are paying attention to their psychological states,” said Yassmin Eldouh, a half Egyptian, half Pilipino PhD student at George Washington University studying counseling and human development. There has been a generational shift taking place. “More and more children of immigrants are turning to services every day,” she said.Even when a Middle Eastern woman decides to break cultural norms and seek help, she may not be able to. Some can’t afford the services. Some don’t have the autonomy to seek out a therapist, as they live with their families. And others simply don’t speak enough English and struggle to find someone who can provide services in their language.“Those who can access services often have a hard time finding a therapist who understands their culture,” Eldouh said. “There are religious institutions training their own counselors, but, outside of houses of worship, too few understand the complexities of Middle Eastern culture and religious tradition well enough to work through them to their clients’ satisfaction.”Eldouh became a therapist after suffering through severe anxiety in her own youth. She struggled to find a counselor who understood her culture and family of origin’s dynamics, or even language.Vowell also struggles: her therapist doesn’t understand Palestinian culture. Vowell explains the customs during sessions and sometimes she records conversations with her family members to help her therapist understand.While this generation is making progress, there are still too many women who are seeking the counsel of patriarchal elders with only the reputation of the family at heart. There are still too many women who endure physical and mental harm and suffer in silence.To combat the stigma, I encourage people to learn about mental health and examine how cultural norms have affected you and your family history.A version of this article was published on The Recovery Team’s website.

      "body": "No person or profession is immune from the impact of the broader culture, and our culture was originally structured to support white, male privilege — thus, the professional world continues to suffer from bias and privilege. Counseling is no exception. Good intentions are not enough. Even the sincerest counselors run the risk of harming clients if they don’t practice introspection, unlearning and relearning ways to be more culturally sensitive and equitable.There are many ways to draw from treatment approaches that extend outside the traditional structure created by and for people from dominant cultures, and to foster healing in ways that are meaningful for each unique client. Through this process, we can center our approach around honoring one’s cultural, racial and intersectional identities. This work also entails honoring the need for collective healing, connection and community.To be inclusive, it’s vital to serve clients with an approach that is culturally affirming and acknowledges their intersectional identities, unique healing traditions and practices specific to the client’s culture.A very important part of being inclusive is honoring ancestral and cultural practices within the healing process, and verbalizing support for the ways someone finds hope and healing within their culture and community.  This includes encouraging participation in culturally specific practices and activities that clients personally enjoy. Keep in mind that people in a specific cultural community are unique, and there’s no one activity that will work or fit everyone.The work to be culturally responsive is no easy task and there is no simple formula for getting this right. Every client we work with will require us to change things up in how we communicate with them and adapt their treatment experience to what works best for them.A few ways counselors can adapt is by receiving training on how to use expressive therapeutic techniques, like art, music, play and movement. Also, by embracing telehealth to reach clients who may otherwise lack access to culturally sensitive care.When it comes to fostering effective advocacy and creating meaningful social change, we cannot underestimate the power of the words we use along the way. Language shapes our perception of the world. Thus, it allows us to shape our world with how we think and speak.When counselors use terms that resonate with their clients’ experiences and validate their identities, clients are more likely to feel safe, truly seen and valued. Without this sense of safety and respect, therapists and clients cannot develop an effective therapeutic rapport.A few techniques counselors can use include:Using psychoeducation about the somatic impact of our experiences, especially trauma and oppression, and learning about body-based healing approaches and interventions that honor the mind-body connection. Creative and expressive forms of therapy (like art and music therapy) and incorporating breathwork and movement in therapy sessions create opportunities for clients to reconnect with their bodies and emotions.Healing cannot begin until the counselor has worked with the client to address racist biases and prejudices and acknowledged the nuanced ways clients of color have internalized beliefs that enable and/or add to their own experiences of oppression. Counselors should explore the impact of their client’s acceptance of negative stereotypes about their racial group, which can cause psychological distress and perpetuate harm. Reclaiming and celebrating one’s racial and intersectional identities is one step toward dismantling internalized oppression.As we expand our awareness and interrogate how biases have shaped our language, interactions, beliefs, values and decision-making — we must replace negative stereotypes with empathy, connection and community.While we’ve shifted our notion of “cultural humility” to go a step further to being “culturally responsive,” humility should absolutely remain a priority as we also focus on our responsive actions. No one can ever be an expert in a culture they do not hold membership in, so staying humble and committed to life-long learning is imperative. Making mistakes and acknowledging how we ourselves have participated in oppressive practices is uncomfortable. Through our discomfort and wrestling, we shed what we need to and open ourselves up for opportunities for something much better. Connection over perfection is the goal.The call to action in serving others within a culturally responsive framework requires going above and beyond to listen, reflect, unlearn, reeducate and act. Cultural competence is not enough to do the job of treating clients within a framework that truly honors their cultural and intersectional identities. Going above and beyond means doing your own work to confront and unlearn your own bias and prejudices. It is accepting that we all have internalized racial biases and commitment to “I don’t see color” does nothing to further social justice.  See color, see differences, see how we are alike and see beauty in a diverse community.Christa Butler, MS, LPC, RPT-S is a Licensed Professional Counselor, Registered Play Therapist Supervisor, Nationally Certified TF- CBT Therapist and a Virginia Board of Counseling approved supervisor.

      "body": "Just over a week ago, the 988 Suicide and Crisis line went live. This important initiative will divert callers away from 911 and connect them to local mental health services, resources or alternative crisis responders. While this is a critical step forward in crisis response, we still have a lot of work to do, as only four states have passed legislation to fund 988 call centers, and many local mobile crisis programs have not been augmented to meet the demand that 988 will bring. As they stand, very few mobile crisis teams in the country are available 24/7 — few of them are able to reliably arrive to help an individual in crisis in less than one hour.I’ve been handcuffed in the back of a police car twice in my life — both times during mental health crisis. I wasn’t violent, threatening to hurt myself or noncompliant. It was just the policy. After going through these experiences, I can speak (with personal experience) to why it is essential for us to invest in these lifesaving crisis response resources.The first time, I was handcuffed at the height of a manic episode. I was extremely agitated; My mind and body were locked into high gear as I paced in circles and chattered on about everything that was running through my head. It had been hard to get more than an hour or two of sleep per night at that point, and I’d wake up drenched in sweat. I was exercising all the time and constantly in motion. As a result, I was rail-thin and on the low end of weight fluctuation that accompanied my bipolar disorder. But I hadn’t been diagnosed yet.My girlfriend Meredith was justifiably concerned by my behavior. She had been trained as a Certified Nursing Assistant and worked as a patient care coordinator for a community health organization. So, when she couldn’t convince me to go with her to get assessed at a mental health facility, she thought about requesting a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officer. CITs are programs designed to teach law enforcement officers about different types of mental illness and how to use de-escalation and calming techniques to handle people experiencing a mental health crisis.Meredith called 911,explained that this was a mental health crisis and requested that our responder have CIT training. Unfortunately, when the police arrived at the door, they were responding to what they thought was a domestic disturbance. When asked about CIT training, the lead officer seemed unfamiliar with the term.By this time, I was sitting calmly at the kitchen table. I remember thinking that I should keep my hands visible, so I placed them on top of the table. To his credit, even without CIT training, the lead officer quickly assessed the situation and asked me what was going on, why they’d been called and if I could express what I thought might help. He talked with Meredith and asked her what she wanted them to do. She asked if they could help get me to a local mental health facility with a crisis stabilization center. He said they could. I agreed to go.Then he said I’d have to go in handcuffs. Everything almost fell apart. I didn’t get belligerent or combative, but I didn’t want to do a “perp walk” in front of the neighbors. I eventually agreed, in no small part because I could see the toll this was all taking on Meredith.My experience could have gone better — I did not do anything wrong and did not need to be restrained — but it also could have been much worse. And if I weren’t white, it could have been much, much, worse. Police are five times more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men over age 54 than unarmed white men the same age. Police are also more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men who exhibit signs of mental illness compared to white men with similar behaviors.That experience was several years ago. I’m now an education, outreach and advocacy volunteer with NAMI Wake County and NAMI North Carolina. They sponsored me to attend the 2022 North Carolina CIT Conference to learn more about CIT and other alternative crisis response models in our state.CIT isn’t the only alternative approach to dealing with mental health crises. For example, co-responder programs embed mental health professionals into patrol divisions so that a law enforcement officer and a mental health professional can respond to crises as two-person teams. There are also Crisis Assistance Helping Out on The Streets (CAHOOTS) programs that respond with two-person teams, but with someone skilled in counseling and de-escalation techniques paired with a medic who is either an EMT or a nurse.Some of the data I saw presented showed that every alternative program studied has provided better outcomes than the traditional approach, with CIT appearing to be most effective in reducing arrests of people with mental illness and increasing the likelihood that individuals will receive mental health services. Among law enforcement officers who have undergone CIT training, 82% believe the training should be mandatory. The element of training that CIT-trained law enforcement officers perceive to be the most beneficial in responding to mental health crisis calls is, by far, the program’s training in de-escalation skills for first responders.Moving forward, we need adequate funding for mobile crisis services, whether through legislation, Medicaid reimbursements or nontraditional funding mechanisms. For example, some funding programs for 911 are still based only on fees from landlines. Since cellular accounts are responsible for more than 80% of total telephone spending, including fees based on cellular service accounts can significantly boost funding.When done well, mobile crisis services save money by putting resources to work where they are most effective. They also reduce officer injuries by up to 80% and, critically, save lives. It's time they became the norm.Ed Ergenzinger is a freelance writer, a patent attorney with a PhD in neuroscience, and a mental health advocate and educator. He also has bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "While the existing models of mental health treatment are founded upon years of research and academic analysis of institutions and people across the world, certain groups of people have been left out of the dialogue — and, historically, they have never had a “place” in healing treatment. This is often rooted in a lack of trust in the system, cultural barriers left behind by old ideologies and racism in all its forms.My academic research background and personal connection to hip-hop has allowed me to discover a new intersectional approach to helping people process trauma. After working in the mental health field for years, and witnessing the lack of cultural competence in our mental health care system, I have become even more committed to uncovering cultural approaches to healing. Specifically, I prioritize using hip-hop for a culture-based approach to healing and personal development.I was left for dead, so to speak, during my adolescence. I experienced violence at home and dealt with parents' mental health issues, substance abuse and other traumas. Yet, in the darkness, I found a faint light: hip-hop.Hip-hop music became my first therapist, my first teacher and my first purpose. When I listened to music, I felt a connection and was able to access my own feelings while beginning to process my trauma. Hearing my own story in the lyrics allowed me to acknowledge my wounds and feel a sense of community during a time of struggle and isolation.Music provided a safe space to explore my thoughts, needs and emotions. It also provided an escape, a way out of my home, even while being at home. Music encouraged me to journal, which became an activity I needed daily and continue to this day.As I entered the mental health space professionally, I witnessed how treatment lacked cultural competence, and I felt limited due to the one-size-fits all treatment model of: Come in, share your experience, identify areas for healing and feel better. This traditional model did not leave space for discussing culture, traditions or how identity operates in forming our sense of self. If a mental health professional had ever asked what music I listen to and why, it would have helped me reflect and understand myself better.There are emerging modalities, like Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT), that bring a breath of fresh air to the field. As I learned how to apply ACT, I realized how important acceptance is for moving past mental obstacles. ACT offers another way to process, to reflect and to be. We often focus goals of treatment on progress, neglecting the fact that some traumas and behaviors will remain, and we need to be able to accept that some traumas linger in the mind and body.After witnessing new techniques in ACT, I began to realize just how important it was to explore fresh perspectives and develop new methods. This got me thinking about how hip-hop music could be a pathway for healing techniques.While working in the mental health field, I heard stories of trauma, which, in turn, connected me to my own traumas from the past. I began to feel the experiences of others in their words. While recording youth telling their stories, I could see them. I mean really “see them” — not just their behaviors or words, but the fullness of their experience. This challenged me to explore the sense of connection that I found in the lyrics in hip-hop music.Hip-hop elements (DJing, MCing, graffiti or dance) provide multiple angles for development. I have taken the practice of rhyming and expression in order to tap into a person’s inner narrative, which, in turn, offers clients a direct line to their own mental health challenges. By doing this, I can help them reframe their inner narrative, which is a major tenant of mental health treatment. Within a 10-week period, we go through a variety of topics with a strong focus on social justice and mental health — not through a traditional academic approach, but one grounded in the experience of rhyming and expressing yourself. Ultimately, the program aims for clients to channel their own voices to heal. We use recording equipment to help with this final piece, which gives the clients agency over their own healing and the opportunity to hear the product of their words.Without cultural context and a deep understanding, using hip-hop as a part of treatment could cause a disconnect. This means that practitioners using hip-hop culture, such as rapping, should study the culture beforehand to better prepare for a variety of outcomes, including a client being triggered by the content. With appropriate preparation and understanding, a practitioner can provide a safe space for processing.It’s time to share what hip-hop is, a powerful path to develop and find purpose. Mental health needs something new, something intentional. It also needs something inclusive. Next time you are listening to your favorite track, reflect on what you’re hearing. What message is there? What potential can you find in the words? Perhaps if you listen well enough, you may just hear yourself in the stories that hip-hop shares with the world.Anthony Pineda founded the Creatrix Institute with the vision of building community, promoting healing, integrating culture and giving people access to personal development. He spends his time in the education and mental health fields, providing programming celebrating hip-hop culture.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Alabama, Arizona and Texas have recently passed legislative efforts to ban gender-affirming health care to transgender adolescents. This is highly concerning and relevant, as 2% of younger Americans identify as transgender, a term that refers to people whose gender identity (an internal sense of self) does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.A gender transition, or the process a transgender person undergoes to express their gender more in line with their internal identity, is a critical component of maintaining their mental health. Research shows that transitioning in affirming environments is life-saving for many transgender people; supportive communities, culturally competent health care and choosing a new name and gender pronouns improves mental health outcomes, including suicidality (which transgender people are significantly more at risk for).Conversely, non-affirming environments and systemic barriers to health care result in higher rates of depression, suicidality and substance misuse in the transgender community, as compared to their cisgender peers. Therefore, we have reason to believe that this anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will worsen the mental health of our transgender youth and adolescents, in addition to increasing the stigma experienced by an already vulnerable population.This challenge is compounded by a shortage of affirming health care providers for the transgender community. As a transgender physician living with mental illness, I understand the fear and pain that the stigma of transgender identity and mental illness can bear when receiving health care services. I am often left feeling unseen or ignored by the health care system at times of my greatest need.In 2015, the National Center for Transgender Equality performed the largest survey of adult transgender community members living within the U.S. The results are eye-opening and point to largescale systemic barriers preventing transgender people from receiving medically-necessary health care services of adequate quality and cultural competence.These findings demonstrate an unaddressed public health issue, but also, they are impacting real people in their everyday lives.While my experience does not represent the full diversity of the gender expansive community, my hope is that sharing my experience will help other transgender people with mental illness feel less alone and have hope for recovery in their journeys.Since coming out and transitioning, I have faced unexpected discrimination within the health care system, even as a physician myself. On multiple occasions, I have been refused medically necessary health care specifically due to my gender identity. This discrimination worsened when I began openly identifying to my providers as a patient experiencing a serious mental illness. Even living in New York City, there are few mental health providers who understand and are affirming of transgender patients. There are even fewer who are transgender themselves or willing to disclose they have lived experience with a serious mental illness.I would have more trust in a mental health provider who is my peer: that is, someone who has lived experience with mental illness and the resulting stigma. As a result, I often need to teach my mental health providers about what it is like to live as a transgender person in recovery from serious mental illness. And professionally, I am left with a small number of colleagues who openly share my identities.When I do find affirming providers, my commercial health care insurance has not covered their services on multiple occasions. I am privileged to be a physician, and therefore, can pay for many of these transition-related expenses out of pocket. This in turn buys me further “passing” privilege, meaning I have undergone a medical and surgical transition, which allows me to appear cisgender. However, there are many others who cannot afford to undergo a medical or surgical transition, or do not wish to do so.I often ask my treating physicians if they have experienced serious mental illness. This is most often met with, “that is none of your business,” when, in fact, I believe it is highly relevant. In these moments, my provider made me feel like they believed mental illness was something shameful. In many stigmatized and shame-based mental illnesses, disclosing a shared identity with a patient can be healing and increase trust in the relationship between patient and physician. Conversely, acknowledging potential awareness gaps and implicit bias is also an important practice for all health care providers.For me, once experiencing the societal sting of transphobia, any other stigmas I hold are no longer worth hiding. I proudly share my identities as a transgender physician living with mental illness, and I believe these experiences have increased my value to society as I can better understand my patients’ perspective and their place within the full range of humanity. This understanding is the basis for a cultural awareness which can improve the healing environment of our offices and the social well-being of our patients.In recent years, I have met many adolescents who boldly identify as neurodivergent, transgender community members. I have faith this generation can help teach physicians to holistically treat their patients and the environmental factors impacting the health of their brains and bodies. I hope some of these adolescents will say, “I can become a doctor, too.”  Because they can, and we can do better to make room for them.If you are transgender and have symptoms of mental illness, please contact a provider experienced in gender-affirming therapy at the World Professional Association of Transgender Health: https://www.wpath.org/provider/search.The Trevor Project has free, confidential, 24/7 support services for LGBTQ+ youth: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/.The following are resources from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBTQ+ youth: https://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbtq-youth.The following are educator resources from the Gay and Lesbian & Straight Education Network: https://www.glsen.org/resources/educator-resources.Pledge to take the 2022 US Trans Survey and increase transgender representation in health care policies, research, education and practice: https://www.ustranssurvey.org/.Z.

      "body": "My father was a psychiatrist in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s. Like many mental health practitioners of his time, he tended to define people by their supposed pathologies: “This one is a depressive,” or “That one is borderline,” and even “Oh, she’s got a paranoid personality.”Thankfully, mental health awareness has progressed significantly since then. With anxiety and depression reaching epidemic levels, the movement to understand and prioritize mental health is gaining momentum, and people everywhere are embracing their diagnoses. The knowledge that they’re living with a health condition like “generalized anxiety disorder” or “major depressive disorder” helps them feel less ashamed of — and less isolated in — their experience. Changing attitudes have also made strides toward destigmatizing treatment like therapy and medication.However, the current conversation about anxiety and depression is lacking a vital dimension: emotional awareness. We are now learning that many instances of anxiety and depression are actually symptoms of buried core emotions and unmet core needs. These types of symptoms — and the use of ineffective treatments to address them — could be prevented with more education surrounding emotions and trauma.Emotions are biological: they live in the body as much as the brain, and they evolved to perform essential functions in our lives. We believe there to be seven innate or “core” emotions that are hard-wired in our nervous systems: anger, sadness, fear, joy, disgust, excitement and sexual excitement. These emotions have a lifespan; when we allow ourselves to feel them (not necessarily acting on them, but allowing the emotions to express themselves), they move through the body and mind and naturally recede like a wave.Then there are the “inhibitory” emotions: anxiety, guilt and shame. These emotions are designed to block core emotions when core emotions come into conflict with what pleases others (like our parents, peers and partners). For example, Lauren, a 40-year-old mother of a three-year-old named Betsy, grew up in a home with lots of violence. As a result, Lauren grew to fear the core emotion of anger, and she learned to shut down her own anger as well as Betsy’s, as it was too threatening for her to tolerate. When Betsy started to express anger at a toy being taken away, for example, Lauren yelled at her: “DON’T EVER TALK TO MOMMY THAT WAY!!” This sudden explosion scared Betsy. As time passed and no room was ever made for Betsy to safely experience her anger, or have it validated by her parents, Betsy’s mind and body learned to suppress anger using muscular contraction and holding her breath. Now instead of feeling anger, Betsy experiences anxiety.Another reason we block core emotions with inhibitory emotions is to prevent us from being overwhelmed or “dysregulated.” When core emotions become too intense, we can shut them down using anxiety, guilt, and/or shame. For example, Tom was taught by his father that “crying and expressing sadness is for weaklings.” Now as a grown man, he feels ashamed every time he feels sad. Feeling shame for his true and natural sadness has contributed to his depression.Because most people don’t know about core and inhibitory emotions, they may feel they are “genetically defective” or “damaged goods.” However, symptoms of anxiety and depression caused by avoided and buried core emotions can be healed with therapy and even eased by simply understanding how emotions work in the mind and body. The issue is that relatively few psychiatrists are taught about the science of emotions in medical school, so they risk misdiagnosing their patients and allowing the root cause of symptoms — the blocked emotions — to go unaddressed.Renowned psychologist Diana Fosha teaches that trauma and psychopathology is caused by experiencing overwhelming emotions in the face of unwanted, utter loneliness. Using this definition, it becomes clear that trauma is a universal human experience. How many of us have had to face our feelings alone for fear of judgment, abandonment or retaliation?Trauma often happens in families and relationships when there’s emotional neglect or abuse. But trauma isn’t limited to what happens in families and relationships: we live in a society and a world filled with violence, stress and injustice.Compounding our distress is the fact that parents and schools have, for the most part, not been given the proper tools to address this subject — and they are often unequipped when it comes to emotional health. As a result, they are not prepared to help children process overwhelming emotions — which is vital for raising calm, confident kids in the context of a chaotic, traumatic world.Additionally, parents who don’t know how to deal with their own strong emotions are unlikely to be capable of helping their children deal with their feelings. Even the most well-intentioned parents can shut down their children’s emotions, and many schools lack the resources they need to help students thrive emotionally.Thus, many children grow up feeling isolated and ashamed of their own emotions. Being shamed and left alone with emotions makes burying them the main strategy to deal with them. With little help for our growing anxieties, we are often left with simmering traumatic stress, which we numb with defensive behaviors, growing further addicted, distracted and disconnected. Perhaps we develop a destructive relationship with food, alcohol or drugs. Perhaps we isolate or lash out.Healing entails processing these emotions, allowing our nervous systems to come back into balance and calm.After receiving my degree in social work, I trained in a healing-oriented, trauma-informed method called accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy (AEDP). In AEDP, symptoms are the starting points to discover the underlying core emotions and needs so we can name them, validate them, honor them and move through them to greater peace and calm.The goal of this process is to move from our defenses, through our inhibitory emotions, to reach our blocked core emotions that are causing the symptoms. Once the blocked emotions are named and validated, people experience enormous amounts of relief, ultimately feeling more confident, calm and connected with their authentic selves. The Change Triangle is a handy map to understand how to move from disconnected depressed states through our core emotions to a more balanced state between our thoughts and emotions.I believe that school health classes should include emotions education in their curricula, and teachers and guidance counselors should receive an emotions education in their own training. Parenting books should include this information as well to help parents learn to be emotionally available, neither threatened by nor frightened of their children’s emotions. On the contrary, they would learn to listen to their children’s feelings with interest but not react, modeling for their children how to validate and be with their emotions.In this ideal world, adults are also better equipped to deal with stress and conflict in their own lives. Whether we are angry, sad, afraid or joyful, those emotions would be named, validated and supported. And we would all learn about triggers — those events that evoke intense emotional experiences. We would rest assured that life triggers strong emotions, and that that is completely natural and normal. It’s the knowledge, tools and practice we’d have that would enable us to respond to triggers in constructive ways.A society with a strong foundation in emotional awareness is a society with high rates of physical and mental well-being. It’s a society that prioritizes authentic connection and collaborative community, because it understands what it truly means to be human.Hilary Jacobs Hendel is author of the international award-winning book, “It’s Not Always Depression: Working the Change Triangle to Listen to the Body, Discover Core Emotions, and Connect to Your Authentic Self” (Random House).

      "body": "In 2013, I was hospitalized — and my entire outlook on life shifted. My doctor diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. My mind was spinning; I didn’t think that someone like me could have that illness. There’s no way I could be crazy, I thought, because I am not weak. Looking back, I can understand that I had been influenced by the tropes of people with mental illness as unsuccessful and fragile. Since then, I have developed coping strategies to manage my illness, stuck to a medication regimen and received both inpatient and outpatient treatment with psychiatrists, therapists and support groups. I soon discovered there’s strength in seeking and accepting help.During this same period, I also experienced major personal and professional success; I earned my master’s degree in public policy before I turned 23, won competitive scholarships, and awards, published my writing and given lectures, interviews and legislative testimony.I’m sharing my story as a reminder that everyday people living with mental health conditions are as capable of success as anyone else — and our identities range far beyond “person with mental illness.” Sometimes, admittedly, untangling my mental illness from my identity is hard. I see myself as a proud, Black cisgender woman who is also a daughter, writer, college graduate, sister, niece, friend, policy researcher, aunt, basketball fan and avid reader, among other things. Over time, I have learned that I can be all these things and find success while living with a mental health condition.Feeling comfortable with the wholeness of my identity took time. Honestly, I’m still grappling with identifying as someone with a mental illness, without letting it define me. I know this will take time.A critical step in accepting my intersecting identities is not letting my mental illness take away from everything I want to be. There are days when I struggle to function — and I have found ways to accept that there will be tough days, but there are ways to ensure that they don’t take over my life.For example, to be a writer, I need rest so I can focus and think clearly. But there are days where I cannot get out of bed, and other days when I can’t sleep; having a sleep imbalance makes producing essays like this a challenge. But when I use my coping skills, take my medication and, when necessary, contact my support team, I am stable and subsequently productive.The phrase “three steps forward, two steps back” captures my experience. While engaging and being productive in life, I have also gone through dark days that resulted in hospital stays.At the beginning of each hospital admission, I would feel crushed. I felt like I was moving backward — that my good fortune had reached the end of its road. But I discovered the same thing about my identity after each hospital stay: I am so much more than my mental illness.I was eventually able to tell myself that being in the hospital was a mental tune-up, and I was there getting help to get back on track.I have attended group therapy and outpatient programs where I’ve met people with similar mental health symptoms, and we’ve connected on a level I cannot with people who don’t have a mental illness. It feels like we have built an instant community.Belonging to a community of diverse individuals who live with a mental illness and also have different — and sometimes overlapping — identities makes me feel less alone and helps me to feel supported.It also helps to see public figures joining our community. I was encouraged when National Basketball Association (NBA) Champion Kevin Love opened up about his life with mental illness and how he still finds success and joy on the basketball court. His story and many other athletes' stories are a reminder that living with a mental illness is not a recipe for failure. Moreover, these stories remind us that it’s ok to be open about living with a mental illness and to allow it to be one piece of who you are.Ultimately, I’ve found that having a mental health condition has added unexpected positives to my life; it has provided me with opportunities to build community and meet inspiring people who have helped me to accept and celebrate myself.I am not sure what the future holds, which is both frightening and exciting. I am unsure how much my mental health will affect my life. But I will continue to cherish my identities, make them stronger and build a deeper connection with them.I’ve accepted there will be obstacles to mental stability, but I’ve also accepted there will be more triumphs. I know I am a multifaceted woman who deserves to thrive today.Next year will be 10 years since I was diagnosed with a mental illness. Despite my humbling success, my personal trials and my inspiring relationships, the real connection between my mental illness and my identity is up to me.Brakeyshia Samms is a writer and policy researcher living with a mental illness.

      "body": "About 2 million times each year, people with mental illness are booked in our nation’s jails, often because communities rely on law enforcement to respond to mental health crises — and they lack the needed resources to truly support someone in crisis. It should not be the job of law enforcement to respond to health care crises, and people experiencing a mental health emergency deserve quick access to effective mental health care — just as people expect when experiencing physical health emergencies.In 2020, Congress passed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, creating 988 as the nationwide number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis response. This number will be available in every community beginning in July this year, with the goal of connecting people in mental health crisis with mental health services.NAMI supports the National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care, released by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in early 2020. This framework identifies three pillars of services that every person experiencing a mental health crisis should have:The second pillar, mobile crisis teams (MCTs), presents an opportunity to significantly reduce the role of law enforcement in mental health crisis response. Unfortunately, very few communities currently have this type of service available.Ultimately, the goal of MCTs is to provide effective and timely care, while allowing individuals to remain in their communities, whenever possible.One of the most well-known and established MCT programs is CAHOOTS, Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, which has been operating in Eugene, Ore., through the White Bird Clinic since 1989. In a NAMI Ask the Expert special webinar series last year featuring CAHOOTS Program Director Ebony Morgan, she described their program as “operating in unarmed pairs with an EMT and a crisis worker.” The service is available throughout the city offering crisis intervention, support and resources to the community.CAHOOTS and similar MCT programs are often dispatched when someone calls 911 or non-emergency police lines. When 988 becomes available, ideally 988 call centers will also be able to dispatch CAHOOTS-like teams — although 911 and 988 should always be in close collaboration. Once on the scene, MCTs assess a situation and are, as Morgan says, “ready to be helpful in whatever way is most effective.”In some cases, a family member may call and request law enforcement, but Morgan notes that often, “Family members don’t know that we’re an option.” In these cases, CAHOOTS will work closely with dispatch and can be sent to the scene. There, they can build rapport with the individual, provide on-the-spot counseling and de-escalation, or transport the individual to a local emergency room that has psychiatric services, if needed.Sometimes, an individual who needs more care than can be provided in the community may not want to go to the hospital. The team can’t force anyone to go anywhere, so instead, they try to explain how it might be helpful. “It’s a lot more comfortable to come with us of your own choice and just ride in the back of our van than to be handcuffed and put in a police vehicle and taken there against your will,” says Morgan. Once at the hospital, the team provides a warm handoff by sharing information with the hospital staff.MCT programs provide many types of support in addition to crisis response. They can provide grief counseling or wellness check-ins They are also trained in basic medical care and carry Narcan, a prescription medication that can reverse an opioid overdose, in case they are first to arrive on the scene. Morgan says CAHOOTS “brings both the medical and crisis intervention perspectives, which allows us to have a more holistic approach to each call.”CAHOOTS leaders agree that partnership with law enforcement is critical. “We are not trained in law enforcement and do not have the same authority as police,” says Morgan. But the partnership with local police is a benefit to everyone, especially law enforcement. “It benefited the police when they were able to drop someone off that did not need to be in jail but did need some support.”Now, CAHOOTS holds monthly meetings with the police department and works collaboratively to solve problems for the community together. Some situations require both the police and the CAHOOTS team to respond together, or one may call on the other for help. “What we do is work with these partners to figure out in what way we can best meet the situation’s needs.”The evidence surrounding the impact of MCTs is compelling. MCTs have been shown to save money by reducing the number of hospital admissions and incarceration for people with mental health needs or substance use disorders. Nearly 85% of people who had an interaction with an MCT received an intervention other than hospitalization.People who have become disconnected from mental health services are more likely to re-engage with those services after having contact with an MCT. This is especially true for those with depressive disorder, mood disorders and psychotic disorders.Creating these teams locally is not a given; advocates will have to push for their availability to ensure that the response we need to divert from justice system involvement when someone calls 988 is available everywhere. It’s critical that advocates push for these programs in their communities and across their state. Bringing key stakeholders to the table, including law enforcement, is important to build programs that have buy-in and cross-system support.There are also opportunities for funding MCT programs that can be leveraged immediately. The recently-enacted American Rescue Plan Act included an option for state Medicaid programs to cover mobile crisis services, which was named after the CAHOOTS program and championed by Senator Ron Wyden (D–Ore). States can currently choose to provide this in their Medicaid program. Additionally, a pending proposal in Congress would establish a grant program to help communities create CAHOOTS-like mobile crisis teams.As we reimagine the future of mental health care, supporting MCTs will be a critical step in transforming our currently insufficient approach to crisis response.Learn more about 988 and the crisis services NAMI is advocating for by visiting nami.org/988.

      "body": "As a mental health specialist and someone who has multiple mental illnesses and associated disabilities, I am no stranger to stigma and discrimination.I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. While I do not have any physical disabilities, I have disabilities associated with my mental illnesses, such as fibromyalgia, that are invisible to others and limit my ability to work. I have been invalidated and outright confronted with discrimination when I verbalize my disability status, and how my mental illnesses are the cause of my disabilities.Disability and mental illness alone are accompanied by significant stigma and discrimination, but when paired together, they result in a unique experience the mental health community calls, “double discrimination.” Mental illness is still so misunderstood, and when an individual has severe mental illnesses that contribute to their disability status, or they have physical disabilities paired with mental illness, others are often unable or unwilling to understand the complex experience. Often, they simply can’t accept another’s experience for what it is.I have learned that I am not responsible for another’s misunderstanding of my experience. However, as a mental health specialist with lived experience, I have found that I can use my perspective to help and educate others.If you also have disabilities and mental illness, the following coping mechanisms may help you navigate double discrimination.This first coping mechanism may be difficult to practice. Speaking out can often be intimidating, but it is important that you have the opportunity to address and condemn discrimination and stigma. One way of speaking out is by telling your story.There are many avenues to share your story and connect with others who may be going through something similar, such as becoming a presenter for NAMI In Our Own Voice. Having this outlet will also add to the collective discussion around double discrimination and help promote acceptance and understanding.I find that I commonly view the discrimination I’ve faced as being my fault; that my disabilities and mental illnesses aren’t “that bad” or that I don’t have the right to be considered disabled. But what I try to remember is that these beliefs have been thrust upon me. I am not the problem. My needs matter and I am important just as I am — and so are you. You are not the problem, the pervasive stigma and discrimination in our society is the problem. Give yourself grace and please remember that discrimination is never your fault.Discrimination can make us feel lesser, and that is a difficult emotional place to navigate. Please take the time to be kind to yourself. Notice any negative self-talk that might arise and try challenging it with affirmations. Some of my favorites are, “My body does not define my worth,” and “My experience is valid.” Try to find some affirmations that you like and write them on sticky notes to put up around your living area where you will see them often. This helps me when I put them on my mirrors, so that the first thing I see when going to look at myself is a positive affirmation.This process is an effective coping mechanism and critical for changing the conversation surrounding mental illness and disability. If you are being discriminated against, it is important that you know that any form of rights violations is a kind of abuse. If you have questions about whether what your experiencing is a violation of your rights, the Department of Justice operates a toll-free information line to provide information and materials to the public about the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act.If your rights are being violated, reporting may be necessary. The NAMI HelpLine can help you to find resources in your area1 to report discrimination.Sometimes when we experience discrimination, we begin to feel less than, which can lead us to abandon our self-care measures. It is during these times that our self-care is of the utmost importance. Try to make sure that you are practicing self-care, even if that means just keeping up with your hygiene rituals. Even simple things, like going on a walk or talking through how you feel with someone you trust, can help. It’s essential to ensure that you are receiving the care you deserve and that often starts with self-care.My experience with double discrimination has often taken the form of watching others deny my story and experience, simply because my disabilities and mental illness are “invisible.” Naturally, this left me feeling invalidated. However, I will always remind myself that just because my challenges are invisible to others, they are not any less real. No one has the right to discredit me and negate my experience.My hopes are that these coping mechanisms encourage you to stand up for yourself and be seen. If adopting these strategies takes time, be kind to yourself; this form of discrimination can be incredibly painful and difficult to work through. You deserve validation and understanding just as much as anyone else.\n\n\nAshley Nestler, MSW, is a survivor of schizoaffective disorder, quiet borderline personality disorder, fibromyalgia, bulimia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder and Complex PTSD.

      "body": "It’s strange. I’ve been writing for 20 years, and writing professionally for 10, and I have never written about my mental health. I’ve even written about other people’s mental health journeys, but I have so much trouble finding the words to describe my own.I’m pretty sure I barely said more than a few words the first time I saw a therapist. But I’ve always been that way. I’m half Filipino and grew up in a small Southern town. Needless to say, I stuck out. In fact, I was the only Asian kid in every school I went to before high school. I didn’t notice until another kid pointed it out to me. Then it was all I could see.The bullying was about what you’d expect: Kids asking me if I ate cats or dogs or made fun of the way my food smelled. I’d like to say I didn’t let this kind of stuff get to me, but I was young, so of course it did. And instead of fighting back, I decided to isolate myself. If no one noticed me, I figured, they wouldn’t make fun of me.I became an expert at blending into the background — only speaking when spoken to and ignoring anyone saying something offensive. I would go straight home after school and retreat to my room instead of joining after-school clubs or sports teams.I don’t know if this was where the depression found its opportunity to latch onto me, but I do remember being withdrawn, especially when it came to crowded social situations.The first time I remember feeling depressed was sometime in middle school. Everything I used to love seemed less interesting. It was like the world had lost all its color, and I was the only one who’d noticed.At the time, I thought this must be something everyone goes through. If not, I reasoned, that means I’m “crazy.” And I didn’t need something else making me stick out, so I kept these thoughts and feelings to myself.I’d have these feelings off and on, but mostly, my school life was normal. I managed to make a few friends despite my isolation tactics, and I’d have my good days and bad days. That was until I finished high school and found out there were ways to make those bad feelings go away.I started to use drugs and alcohol to numb my feelings. This self-medicating worked until the drugs triggered my anxiety. During my worst trip, I had a bad panic attack. I was so convinced that I was going to die that I called my girlfriend to hear her voice one last time. Thankfully, I was able to make it through the panic attack with her help, and afterwards, doctors prescribed me anti-anxiety medications. I figured that this medication would end the struggles I was facing.It wasn’t long after that I experienced the worst depressive episode of my life. Simply “getting through” every day felt like a challenge. Nothing I used to love made me feel better, and I felt like I was becoming a burden to my friends and family. One night, I considered ending my life. I considered it for a long time. In a moment of clarity, I called my girlfriend (now wife), and she convinced me to go to the emergency room.I was always adamant about checking myself into a hospital for mental health issues. The same thoughts kept running through my head: What if someone finds out? What will my parents think? Will I be able to go back to school after this? But I just couldn’t take it anymore. If the doctors couldn’t help me, then I had nothing to look forward to. I already felt dead.I ended up spending a week in the hospital’s mental health ward, where I saw my first therapist and met others experiencing the same illness. Granted, everyone had their own stories and reasons for being there, but we found common ground. Though I was scared, I ended up learning a lot about myself during that hospital stay. And I still had a lot more to learn.Over the years since my hospital visit, I’ve continued seeing a therapist, who has helped me realize that no one can “fix me.” I’m the only one that can find the right coping mechanisms. And every day I’m working to be a better, happier version of myself. I still have bad days. I have days where everything seems grey, and nothing makes me happy. However, I can see myself through those days now. I feel as though I’m still stuck in the middle of a forest, but at least this time, I know the way out. Even if it is a long, dark walk.Anyone who lives with depression knows that finding emotional well-being is less of an uphill battle and more of an up-and-down roller coaster. It is a journey that requires vulnerability, patience and resilience.I’ve learned that when it comes to the Asian-American experience with mental illness, our stories our similar, but never exactly the same. I’ve met members of our community who said their family told them to hide their mental illness as it could keep them from getting a good job. My family may not have understood what I was going though at first, but they’ve always been supportive of me seeking out help.What we all seem to share is a shame that goes along with having a mental illness. And that shame can come from many places; be it the pressure of trying to fit into a place when you feel like it doesn’t want you, or the pressure of trying to meet high expectations. Either way, a lot of us don’t like talking about our mental health.I’m not sure there’s a way to get rid of the shame, especially since a lot of us have dealt with it from a young age. But I can feel myself getting better. And I can only hope others with mental illness can also find healthy ways to deal with it.To those struggling with depression (particularly young people) who haven’t told anyone about it, I urge you to share. I know that disclosing this information can be difficult, especially in a community that, traditionally, hasn’t been as open to discussing mental illness as it should.But there is help available.John Ridlehoover lives with his wife and two dogs in South Carolina.

      "body": "Although rooted in ancient civilizations and found in every culture, music is often not recognized as central to wellness and therapeutic services. However, through my academic and professional work as a music therapist, I have witnessed the healing power of music.Music therapy is an evidenced-based, safe and effective form of treatment provided by trained professionals and can be a part of a successful treatment program for people with mental health needs. If you’re interested in exploring music therapy, here is what you need to know.According to the American Music Therapy Association, music therapy is “an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of individuals.”Starting with an assessment, a qualified music therapist develops a treatment plan, including a variety of music-based activities to address the clients’ needs and desires for treatment. Through this process, clients can improve depressive symptoms, increase emotional expression, develop positive relationships, address loneliness, grief and loss — and improve their overall quality of life. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves using words.The following activities serve as interventions to address goals around self-regulation, coping skills, emotional expression, enhanced mood, social interactions, attention and focus:Listening to music:  This can include listening to music for relaxation, performance improvement, to regulate internal systems (such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) and to reminisce on past memories or experiences.Musical re-creation:  This approach can address self-expression by playing or singing along to new or familiar tunes.Improvisation: Improvisation is the act of creating unplanned music alone or with someone else. This can increase connection and engagement and foster self-expression. It can also increase attention and focus through active listening and response.Songwriting: A client and music therapist will work together to create and notate instrumental and/or lyrical music. This technique can address emotional and social goals for the client.Music games and lessons: This approach uses planned musical activities to promote rehabilitation in an engaging way.Music therapy can help people in many areas of life. This may include emotion and mood regulation, psychological stability, physical health, spirituality, cognitive maintenance/development and social benefits. Other benefits of music therapy include:A professional music therapist holds a bachelor's degree or higher in music therapy from an AMTA-approved college and university programs. The curriculum focuses on: musical foundations, clinical foundations and music therapy principles as specified in the AMTA Professional Competencies. In addition to the academic coursework, the bachelor's degree requires 1200 hours of clinical training, including a supervised internship. Graduate degrees in music therapy focus on advanced clinical practice and research.Music therapy is offered in both individual and group formats in child and adolescent behavioral health, as well as with adults. Music therapists are found in many settings, including inpatient and outpatient psychiatric hospitals, detoxification and relapse prevention programs, forensic or correctional settings, private in-home services and many more. It has demonstrated effectiveness for clients living with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, trauma and stressor-related disorders, disorders, personality disorders and more.Music therapy is also an effective treatment method for children with mental health needs. Because of the nonthreatening nature of music, children often respond well to music interventions and enjoy this treatment model. When guided by a clinical music therapist, music can help children and adolescents:The same rules apply for seeking music therapy as any other mental health service. When symptoms are interfering significantly with your day-to-day life, with your ability to go to or be productive at work/ school or interfering with your relationships, music therapy may be a good treatment. If you’re looking to improve depressive symptoms, improve emotional expression, foster positive relationships, or address loneliness, grief and loss, then you should consider pursuing this model of treatment.If you are feeling overwhelmed or experiencing grief, living with substance abuse and/or dependence, have experienced a traumatic event or sustained trauma, music therapy would be a good avenue to address these concerns.To learn more, The American Music Therapy Association recommends accessing “The Journal of Music Therapy: (JMT) and “Music Therapy Perspectives” (MTP) social media channels:Melinda Murray, MM, MT-BC is a Board-Certified Music Therapist with 12 years of experience working at Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital in Kalamazoo, Mich.  Her undergraduate degree is from DUNY Fredonia in Music Therapy and Minority Studies, and she received her master’s degree from Western Michigan University in music therapy with a master’s certificate in holistic health.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Throughout my childhood, I was often punished for my emotions: if I had an angry outburst, if I cried or if I was frustrated and had an “attitude.” I know that my parents loved me, and that they were only parenting the best way they knew how, based on their own upbringing. I know they meant me no harm. But their actions were, indeed, harmful; it would take me years to fully process the extent of the trauma.I’ve learned that there is no taking back past actions and changing our history. But there can be healing.The thing about healing is, not only do many of us not know it’s possible — we do not even know we need it. For a long time, I didn’t. But five years ago, with the help of a therapist, I realized that the word “trauma” applies to some of my past experiences. Since then, I have made baby steps in my healing journey.At first, I believed that childhood trauma could be dealt with quickly; after my therapist and I revisited some of these past traumas, I thought, well, that’s that, I’m healed.In reality, I had a long way to go. Sometimes, having revisited my past feels like opening a floodgate of utter chaos. Often, I find myself drowning in my emotions.In addition to processing my past, I had to face the challenges of our mental health care system. My therapist left the practice for another one that didn’t take my insurance. After that, I bounced around to several different therapists, which added more stress to my journey.With my current therapist, I feel like I’m making progress again, although slow. Painfully slow. So slow that the day before Easter Sunday, I got triggered and began experiencing suicidal thoughts. I planned to take my life and wrote goodbye letters to my mom, my two children (who were with their father) and my two best friends.I cried so hard, writing those letters. I have lost a loved one to suicide, so I knew, as I wrote them, exactly how my loved ones would feel once I was gone. In the moment, I was willing to inflict that pain to alleviate my own. But by the time I finished writing the fifth letter, I was spent. I just wanted to sleep. I decided to reassess in the morning.The next morning, I went for an assessment at a behavioral health hospital near my home. I was admitted to an inpatient program, where I stayed for eight days. Currently, I am completing an outpatient partial hospitalization program. The group therapies, both inpatient and out, have been incredibly helpful to me.In one group discussion, we talked about radical acceptance — specifically, about “turning the mind” toward acceptance. We talked about willfulness and combating willfulness. I shared how it was only very recently that I learned it is often necessary to “sit with” uncomfortable emotions — to fight the urge to avoid or immediately “fix” that uneasy feeling.When I felt loneliness or grief or overwhelming sorrow, my mind often chastised me and demanded I think differently: “Reframe the thought! Positive affirmations!” But my time in therapy taught me that I can talk back to this voice in my head without being negative. I can answer it with “I’m allowed to feel this way!”Giving myself permission to feel my grief and sorrow — for things that happened at all stages of my life — was an important step.There is nuance in every lesson. I need to learn to “sit with” the difficult feelings — but without sitting so long that the pain overwhelms me for an extended amount of time. I never want the pain to cause me to question whether I want to continue living again. But I am learning.The depth of the pain I feel, when I allow myself to feel it, is not necessarily lessening. And I don’t know if it ever will. But what I do know is allowing myself to feel my feelings is progress.I am not okay, and that’s okay. I am not alone. I am allowed to feel the way I feel. We can’t heal what we don’t let ourselves feel.This blog post was written by an anonymous contributor with the help of NAMI Staff.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I experienced my first panic attack when I was only nine years old. It happened out of the blue, while I was in school, and I didn't know what was happening to me. All of a sudden, I couldn't breathe. I stuck my head out the window to catch my breath, assuming the difficulty breathing was due to allergies. When my breathing did not improve, I ran into the hallway, where I fell to the ground, overwhelmed and feeling intense pain all over my body. I didn't faint, but I felt light-headed and dreadful.My nine-year-old self immediately thought, \"I'm dying!\"The school wanted to call an ambulance, but they reached my parents first, and my mom rushed to my rescue. She knew how much I was suffering from bullying and stress at the time, and she attributed my symptoms to a panic attack.Thankfully, I got into therapy almost immediately after the incident. I was initially diagnosed with claustrophobia; however, through my work in therapy, I have learned that the claustrophobia was just a manifestation of my fears and problems. My behavior was always caused by an underlying stress — in this case, being bullied — rather than being about small spaces. In fact, sometimes I would be in a large room, but I would escape to a smaller space so I could have a reason to break down and externalize the pain I was feeling.Today, I’m still working with my therapist who is a wonderful woman. With her, I can discuss everything that is on my mind, and usually feel much better after the session. We don’t reach solutions right away, but I’ve found that for every problem, sooner or later, I will find an answer or a way to cope.I’m 14 years old now, and a lot has changed in the past five years. The bullying stopped, and I no longer have claustrophobia or the urge to incite my own panic. But I still face mental health challenges.My panic attacks continue, but they have evolved to coincide with new triggers — including crowds of people, how others talk to me, certain words or the volume at which someone speaks to me. This can be difficult to manage, as certain people and teachers at school also trigger me. It may seem odd to others, but these triggers can change on a weekly basis.My symptoms have also begun to feel different; I no longer hyperventilate, but at times, it feels like my nerves go haywire — like lightning strikes my body. Sometimes, my hands and legs start shaking. Other times, panic attacks will take the form of a severe headache or aching limbs, with a roaring in my ears or abdominal pains and cramps. Despite the frustrations of living with panic attacks, I have seized the opportunity to become an expert on my own condition.Over time I’ve gotten better at identifying and coping with each type of panic attack. I always have an emergency kit with natural sedatives, like chamomile, at hand. I have learned that walking up and down the hallway often helps me to self-soothe and recenter. I’ve even established a kind of internal “reference book” containing the different types of attacks and the appropriate responses. I know exactly when drinking a glass of water and sitting on the sofa works — or when running around the school building a few times is best.Perhaps the most important step I have taken is learning to calm myself down. As a nine-year-old, I let my fears consume me. Now, I say to myself, \"Okay, Ella, you're having a panic attack now. Lie down, read a page in your book and then move on.” This kind of relaxing and letting go consciously takes practice — but it has dramatically changed my quality of life.Looking back, I would advise little Ella: \"Go on with your life. Find people you like and trust, talk to them.\" I’m fortunate to have my family — and I know not everyone has that support. But I hope that those who don’t have family support can talk to friends, school counselors or even a pet. Speaking thoughts out loud and validating your emotions (while realizing that your fears may not be real) is key.As I’ve navigated my recovery journey, I’ve continued to speak up about my experience. I want people to know that they are not alone. Recovery takes time and it is not always linear.Being vocal about my mental health gave me the chance to join a mental health startup called Earkick— an app designed to help people track their anxiety and better understand what coping mechanisms work best for them. As I reflected on my own journey, I realized that I had a chance to use my experience to help others.What began as a few phone calls eventually turned into my heart’s project. I love this work — figuring things out and tinkering with solutions. This app has also helped me personally; sometimes, when I’m having a panic attack, I do a voice recording on the app so I can listen to my thoughts and determine that my perceptions don’t necessarily represent reality. They are just thoughts, not facts. And I am not my thoughts.Ultimately, I want to go on to college and create a startup of my own. I’ve been through a lot, but I’m learning to make the best of it and use my experience to help others.Ella Mona is a 14-year-old student.

      "body": "Young adulthood is a complex time marked by growing independence and personal responsibility. It is also a time of apprehension for both young people and their caregivers. For parents, it can be easy to write off their teens’ challenges during this time as “angst” or “just a part of growing up” — and they may not recognize serious distress or signs of an emerging mental illness. Recognizing and correcting this misstep is critical, particularly before teens go to college, which can be a high-risk time for many reasons.Understanding and appropriately anticipating mental health risks to college-bound teens is critical for parents to address any issues that arise. For those sending a child off to college, make sure to keep the following in mind.Perhaps the most proactive way to support your child’s mental health in college is to help them find the “right” school. This requires consideration of personal, emotional and social factors — including distance from home, size of the school, access and responsiveness of support services, the emotional-social climate on campus and your child’s personality and needs.When students find a school that aligns with their values and needs, they are more likely to reap the benefits of attending college: finding a passion, meeting new people and graduating with better career options. A poor college fit, however, is more likely trigger certain mental health issues. For teens who don’t know where to begin, The Jed Foundation offers an online quiz to help students assess fit.As a parent, your role is to encourage your children to fully assess their college options to find the school that will best support their social, emotional and academic needs. During college tours, you may want to learn about on-and off-campus mental health resources, including provider availability (especially given shortages and treatment options) and insurance coverage.You will also want to prepare your teens for college-related stressors they may experience, regardless of school fit. Discussing potential challenges — and highlighting that challenges are a common part of the college experience — is a good place to start.Given that 75% of mental illnesses begin by age 24, symptoms of mental health conditions may emerge during the college years. Unsurprisingly, then, more than 30% of college students were diagnosed or treated for anxiety, and 22% for depression, in the last 12 months.The emergence of symptoms often has an impact beyond emotional challenges; of the students diagnosed with depression or anxiety, more than 50% experience adverse academic impacts due to their condition. You can be proactive in supporting your children’s health by learning the warning signs of mental health conditions (depression and anxiety, in particular) which often include hopelessness, dramatic change in behavior and withdrawal or social isolation. Given the strong connection between mental health and academic performance, it can also be helpful for parents who are concerned about their child’s mental health to have access to grades under FERPA (which requires your child’s permission).Perhaps the most important way to support your child’s mental health is by providing emotional support. Young adults are most likely to succeed in their new environment if they’ve built self-esteem, self-worth, self-confidence and resilience — skills that you can help them build through affirmation and modeling healthy self-talk.A few approaches to model or teach this behavior include: demonstrating empathy and compassion, having and showing gratitude in response to challenges and reframing negative situations. Having these skills and knowing they have the support of their families will help students cope with other stressors, such as building relationships, academic pressures (which can be the greatest source of stress) and career planning.Other important skills you can help your child learn and develop during their college years, include independent living, smart decision-making about safety, time management and stress management.When you want to know more about your child’s life, especially if you’re concerned about their well-being, you’ll want to carefully assess what topics to bring up, how to bring them up and when to talk about them. Anticipating and discussing the stresses of on-campus life can be very helpful. For those who have a loved one living away from home, a communication contract can help. This agreement could include an agreed video call schedule and preset topics of discussion.Other ways to facilitate frequent communication include encouraging children to come home, having scheduled family get togethers and urging your children to maintain social connections with hometown friends, extended family members and even local counselors. Making on-campus visits also provides an opportunity to keep up.Ideally, you will have trusting relationships with your children that allow you to facilitate discussions regarding any concerns. A trusting relationship — one in which you can comfortably bring up mental health concerns — requires a solid foundation; You should reassure your children that you are “always there for them” if they would like to speak.If you notice any signs of distress or emerging mental illness, whether at home or on campus, you should reach out to your child. Calm, clear and honest communication is essential; give your child the opportunity to share their concerns first, and you’ll want to find common ground and explain your concerns. Naturally, these discussions may be difficult if your child is trying to assert their independence and maintain control. But establishing open communications and learning to compromise can be critical to healthy relationships.When your child leaves for school, you’ll want to have an idea of what resources and mentors will be available to them (and possibly your family). Nearly every university has a disabilities and accommodations office, which grants eligible students with disabilities accommodations that can facilitate the completion of school work. These include extra time to complete assignments and exams and tutoring. They also handle medical leave requests, should this be necessary.Parents and caregivers can play a critical role in noticing that their college student may be struggling. Most importantly, they will play a critical role in supporting their children through those mental health challenges to ensure they can flourish during the college years.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "Until I was 30 years old, I had I had never been to therapy before; I always thought I was someone who didn’t “need” to go to therapy — what did I have to talk to a therapist about?And until I was 30, I never told a soul that I had been sexually abused as a child. It never entered my consciousness that it was something I would say out loud — or even could verbalize.From the time I was 10 to about 12 and a half, my older brother molested me. I never told anyone about it because I was ashamed of what had happened; I was scared of the consequences of telling, and I didn’t have the words to explain what had happened. Most of all, I wanted to pretend like it had never happened.I buried so much of myself. I simply thought, Real men don't admit things like this. When I was in middle school and high school, I thought, you can never tell anyone — imagine all the terrible things that would happen if you did. The humiliation.Then, when I was 30 and had started a relationship with the woman who would later become my wife, thing started to change. We were having issues related to sex and intimacy, and she urged me to speak to a therapist.The intake form for that first therapist asked whether I had ever been the victim of neglect or physical, emotional or sexual abuse. I checked yes next to sexual abuse because I didn’t want to lie and then have it come up later in the sessions. I assumed I’d get in trouble. I brought up what happened in my first session, and the therapist thanked me for trusting her with that information, but I said I didn’t want to talk about it, because that’s not why I was there.A few months later, when she left her practice, she told me that, in her experience, someone who has been sexually abused as a child is bound to have that ripple out into all facets of their life, including their intimate relationships. She urged me to start widening the circle of people who knew.Shortly thereafter, I started seeing a new therapist who specializes in helping those who have experienced trauma, who I am still working with today. I gained more courage to tell others, including my then-girlfriend, my friends, family members and my parents (who, thankfully, believed me but expressed no interest or ability into delving into how and why this happened in our family).When I started my journey, I didn’t know that 1 in 13 boys (and 1 in 5 girls) are likely to experience child sexual abuse. I thought there must have been something different about me, something wrong with me specifically. I felt isolated, scared and ashamed.In the years since I first started processing my trauma, I have come to recognize many things about the abuse and about myself. I didn’t do anything wrong. Someone wronged me, hurt me and betrayed me. I did not have the emotional wherewithal or vocabulary to tell anyone about the abuse at the time, and it is completely normal and understandable for children not to tell.I also had the incredible opportunity to participate in a group therapy setting in the fall of 2019 with five other men who were also sexually abused as children. We talked about the persistent stigma surrounding men disclosing that they were sexually abused as children.We discussed how our culture still largely sends the message to men that you cannot be a “real man” if you admit to being abused, or that you’ll somehow be thought of as “less than” or weak. And we discussed how, while we were all in different places in our healing journeys, we could relate to each other’s feelings about the abuse, our masculinity and our senses of self.Men who have been sexually abused are not “less than” men who have not been abused. They are not defective. They are full human beings who have been through the crucible of trauma. They deserve compassion and support, not ostracism or scorn. I feel such a deep connection to that group of survivors. Those men are warriors.In addition to regular therapy (including, recently, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy), I’ve sought to heal through creative writing and poetry. Writing helped me process and come to terms with the abuse. My debut poetry collection, “How to Bury a Boy at Sea,” was published in April. I hope it can be used as a healing tool for survivors, their loved ones, therapists and educators. Most importantly, I hope it helps other survivors, and men especially, feel less alone and more understood.There are, unfortunately, many more of us out there than other survivors likely know. And there are so many incredible people, resources and organizations, including NAMI, that can help if you decide you are ready to seek it. The more men who come forward and speak about child sexual abuse, the less power the social stigma holds. I’m glad I stopped being silent, because I realized I had nothing to be ashamed of. Being abused is something horrible that happened to me — it is not who I am.To all who have been abused, and men especially, I urge you to talk with someone about what happened — if and when you feel comfortable. I want you to know that you are not alone. \n\n\nPhil Goldstein is a poet, journalist and content marketer.

      "body": "The mental health of today’s young people is reaching crisis levels.A recent CDC survey discovered that 37% of U.S. high school students reported regular mental health struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to The Trevor Project, 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children’s Hospital Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recently declared this crisis a national emergency.As the mental health conversation has evolved, schools have become at the forefront of mental health initiatives. 30% of all students who receive mental health services find that support in schools  — making our education system the most accessed mental health delivery system by children and adolescents.As schools and universities rush to keep up with the increasing demand for mental health resources, students say that what’s currently being offered at school to address mental health is not enoughIn our new study from Springtide Research Institute that surveyed over 3,000 students and interviewed 80 more, students said their schools often provide “performative,” “inconsistent” and “reactive” mental health interventions — like providing support dogs during finals week — but fail to sustain a mental-health friendly culture at school that supports students consistently.“In my university context, performative mental-health resources, especially those that aren’t long-term, do more harm than good,” explained Lana, a 22-year-old university student. “Bringing in dogs to pet at the library during finals does not address the core element of why students have an uptick in hotline calls from stress and anxiety during finals and the weeks leading up to them.” She went on to say, “Therapy dogs aren’t going to solve that. We need consistent mental health resources that address how academia is structured to make students stressed.”Students also expressed frustration that school initiatives don’t address the underlying reasons for stress — namely, the stressors that come from school.Julie, a 17-year-old high school student, explained, “Even guidance counselors at school will be like, ‘Oh, is everything okay? Oh no, it’s not? Well, I’ll help you, but you have to get a good grade on your test because you don’t want your grades suffering.’” Julie explained that what students need is “somebody to talk to who’s going to help us — who doesn’t have any motive besides just wanting us to get better. Our guidance counselors, even though they’re great, they have that mode of like, ‘Okay, how are we going to pass those classes?’”Additionally, students say their schools seem to encourage the pressure to achieve constant success and to be perpetually busy for the singular goal of getting into college. Sophie, Sofia and Acadia, all high school students, told Springtide they are rarely encouraged to pursue goals and activities that aren’t directly related to college ambitions.“We are expected to do clubs, sports, AP classes, college classes and work, all so that we can get into a good college,” they said in a combined statement. “At times, it seems that schools’ systems push the idea of college and career so much that they forget to tend to students’ hearts and souls.”A major issue with school initiatives to address mental health is that they often fail to address the systemic nature of the mental health crisis. What is currently happening in most schools, students say, is crisis response, when what's really needed is crisis prevention.This doesn’t negate the importance of crisis response; schools and educators place focus there for good reason. However, the problem arises when schools simply default to a crisis response that is “inconsistent, and frankly, doing more for the university’s image than the well-being of their students,” Lana, a 22-year-old university student, explained.We must expand the conversation from the individual — that is, moving away from asking what one person can be doing differently to improve their own mental health — and begin to address the issue as a collective concern: What can organizations, groups and schools specifically do to better support the mental health of their young people?As sociologists, we know our role is not to do the work of therapists, teachers, counselors, etc. Instead, our work is to shine light on what young people are telling us. When it comes to the resources and tools they need to thrive in their mental health, we noticed a few themes.Students thrive when schools promote deep social connections. These connections engender a sense of belonging for young people, which is essential to their mental wellness. Springtide has identified that a sense of belonging requires that young people feel noticed, named and known. Teachers play a special role here: Students who had a meaningful interaction with a teacher or professor were significantly less likely to feel lonely at school.Students need to have achievable expectations and the tools they need to meet those expectations. A school cannot authentically say they prioritize mental health if they are giving their students enough homework to keep them up past midnight to get the grades they desire. Schools needs to take a proactive approach to curriculum design so that teachers can get the best out of their students academically while accepting their mental health needs.Schools have an opportunity to create a sense of purpose in young people. There’s a prevailing sense among young people that their purpose at school is to get good grades. But fostering purpose at school also means encouraging young people to find their connection to something bigger than themselves —what they want to accomplish, who they want to become and how they want to make a difference. Students discovering a bigger purpose at school, we found, are more likely to say they’re “flourishing a lot” in their mental health.If schools commit to fostering a mental-health friendly culture that deepens social connections, provides the tools students need to meet achievable expectations and promotes a sense of purpose in young people — they will be better equipped to prevent mental health crises and enable all students to thrive.Kevin Singer is Head of Media and Public Relations at Springtide Research Institute and a professor at two community colleges.Sam Ludlow-Broback is a Media Relations Intern for Springtide Research Institute.Springtide Research Institute’s report, “Mental Health & Gen Z: What Educators Need to Know,” is available for purchase here.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "It wasn’t just the number of questions the boy asked, but the way he asked them.I was speaking to a packed auditorium of seventh and eighth graders about my first novel, “Under a War-torn Sky.” I was new to school author visits then, but I’d already grown accustomed to the urgency of book-loving 13-year-old boys, eager to show off their knowledge of the aircrafts referenced in my book. Like so many young people that age, this student’s face was a magical mixture of child and on-the-cusp adult, all earnest, itchy energy.But this was different — beyond smart-student literary insight. He kept asking about my hero’s father, a prototypical, Great-Depression-era, tough-love farmer. Why was he so harsh? Had my protagonist done something to deserve it? And just like my hero anguishes: did that father really love his son, given how hard he pushed him?I exchanged a glance with his teacher who nodded a promise she’d follow up. When she did, the student opened up about his dad and what turned out to be a case of PTSD and depression.Building awareness and understanding of mental health has long been a \"mission\" of mine, first as a senior writer with the Washingtonian magazine, then as a historical/biographical fiction writer.As a journalist, I’d had the extraordinarily rewarding and humbling experience of hearing from people who’d sought therapeutic help after reading my articles recounting the struggles of individuals who’d lived the issue and survived.But that student taught me the power of a well-told novel.After many years of writing, I’ve learned that that a character’s emotional journey can speak to an unnamed uneasiness within young readers’ hearts. Novels with accurate, sensitive presentations of mental health issues can provide a fictionalized, safe distance for youth to recognize challenges they’re facing themselves and talk about them thematically rather than in a personal or confessional way. This, in turn, allows for a less self-conscious discussion, in addition to providing clear clues to adults that a child might need help.I wrote my latest work, “Louisa June and the Nazis in the Waves,” during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as we grappled with its unforeseen, deadly threat. As a historical fiction writer, I’ve learned the power of presenting issues in a past era rather than present day — it removes the heat of immediacy, lowering readers’ defensive, self-protective guardrails.As I was writing, Nazi U-boats suddenly trolling our coastline became a metaphor for the lightning quick aspect of the terrifying pandemic my readers were experiencing firsthand. Life turns on a dime for my protagonist Louisa June as she faces the out-of-the-blue death of her beloved brother — a  devastating loss similar to the unanticipated illness or death of immediate or secondary caregivers (parents, grandparents, extended family) which an estimated 1.5 million children under the age of 18 are currently grappling with because of COVID, according to the NIH.My hope is that “Louisa June” resonates with readers facing their own loss — that they find hope and reassurance in Louisa June’s strength and journey to healing. Also, that their friends, who were luckier, find sympathy and understanding of the grieving process.This book carries an additional undercurrent about emotional health and depression in family members — which can be a different thing entirely from grief, of course. Says Louisa June: “My mama has the melancholy. But recently it’s gone from her customary pinkish-gray — like a dawn mist in the marshes, still hopeful and able to clear into bright blue with the right sprinkle of sunshine — to thick, storm-surge purple black.”An estimated one in five children live with a depressed parent, many of whom, tragically, go untreated. My goal is to have “Louisa June” help tweens in similar situations to feel seen and understood. To be encouraged by the supportive example of LJ’s elderly Cousin Belle to ask adults they trust for help, especially in this time of increased mental health struggles.In England, bibliotherapy — the process of reading, reflecting on and discussing literature to encourage a cognitive shift — is a respected treatment option akin to music or art therapy. Studies show that people who read regularly are more able to empathize with others, but the effects of a good book are even more wide-reaching. In the mayhem of day-to-day life, we may forget what we felt in English class when reading a novel in which we saw ourselves and therein found a sense of communion. That wonderment Charlie expresses in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”: “It's strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.”Learning expert Rachael Walker created a discussion guide using “Louisa June” as a springboard for discussing emotional wellness with students. I recommend using this tool to encourage children’s creativity while they process complex feelings. I particularly love the art project playing off the poetic nature of Louisa June’s lost brother, his ability to find uplifting moments of beauty even in life’s darker moments.Following his example, even though Nazi U-boats lurk in the waves, Louisa June thinks on the stars reflection in the water, a life-preserver reminder that “something beautiful and mystical, something uplifting, floated there, too.” The exercise encourages students to identify what “stars in the waves” elevate them and help them cope, then pin them on posters of turbulent waves.L.

      "body": "Generally, anger is a natural response to distressing issues or situations — yet, it is often felt or expressed in ways that are scary, confusing or even unhealthy. As a result, we often consider anger to be a “bad” emotion, and we view its expression as destructive. Accordingly, experiencing anger can be difficult for both children and adults.Naturally, anger is a feeling most people prefer not to experience. But when we understand anger, it can become a healing, transformative and empowering force. Anger in children can be a response to a situation that's in need of a solution. It can alert others that more love, safety or protection is needed. Anger in a child can help them learn more about their own needs and self-care or how to vent feelings of frustration. Anger does not have to be a negative experience.Most children require guidance, support and instruction as they learn to identify and regulate their anger. It’s not always easy for little ones to understand feeling mad. What we don't want to do as adults is to stigmatize or present anger as a bad emotion to feel or express. We want to encourage children to be mindful about their frustrations — why they occur, how to express them and what they can do to problem solve.You can explain to little ones that anger is an emotion that arises when we feel frustrated, disappointed or hurt. Teach them that anger is something adults and children feel — even babies, too. Help them understand that anger is a natural reaction, but there are ways for it to be expressed in healthy and unhealthy ways.Anger can be expressed in adaptive ways (mindful words and problem solving) or maladaptive ways (yelling, getting physical or being aggressive). Helping children to understand healthy expressions of anger will give them self-confidence, teach them positive social interactions and encourage them to self-regulate confusing emotions. Remind children to \"Use your words\" when anger presents. This will help little ones move away from using physicality, like breaking toys, hitting or other aggressive behaviors to express anger.When your child shows maladaptive anger, you can redirect them by prompting, “Instead of throwing your toys, tell me what’s bothering you.” “Instead of hitting your brother, tell him what’s making you mad.” Make sure you praise the adaptive expression of anger so your child can feel good about their choices and you can reinforce that behavior.It’s important to help children understand why they are angry. Encourage them to identify what the situation is that’s made them react. What need is not being met? Who or what is frustrating them? This helps children construct a mindful view of anger and why it's happening.You’ll also want to teach your children ways to problem solve their anger. Does the situation need a compromise? “Maybe you and your brother can take turns playing with the swing.” Do they need boundaries? “I know you’re angry that it’s getting late, and we have to leave the park. You can choose only one more ride at the park before we go home, or we can go home now. What would you like to do?” Or is your child’s anger from fatigue, hunger or sleepiness? “Do you think you’re hungry for a snack? Or you’re sleepy? Could that be why you’re mad right now?”Make sure you take the time to model these strategies whenever you can. When you show your child your own angry feelings, how you express them in healthy ways and problem solve the situation to reduce your anger, you reinforce their evolving skillset.Ultimately, anger is an emotion that can be difficult for children to understand and experience. With guidance from adults, little ones can learn how to identify irritability, express it in adaptive ways and determine that “being mad” can lead to meaningful outcomes.Dr. Deborah Serani is a psychologist and author of “Sometimes When I'm Mad” by Free Spirit Publishing.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Mental health — and mental illness specifically — can be very difficult to understand and navigate for anyone, but especially for children. Children, more so than adults, have difficulty processing emotions and psychological changes. As a result, they often exhibit behavioral challenges when they don’t fully understand their emotional state. I noticed this with my own children; when my kids were younger, they would get frustrated and throw tantrums because they couldn't articulate their feelings.I often think back to my childhood and my experience with mental illness. When I was younger, I would experience panic attacks and depressive episodes. But back then, I didn’t know what they were. I assumed they were simply a part of life, and I carried on like everything was ok. As a result, I wasn’t properly diagnosed with a mental health condition until I was well into my twenties.I didn’t want my kids to have the same experience of confusion and uncertainty, so I took it upon myself to have open conversations about mental health with them. Here are some of the things I did to make the topic more accessible.One of the things I found most beneficial when discussing mental health with my family was to help my kids label what they were feeling. The Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development recommends making or drawing facial expressions for young children and asking them to guess what emotion you’re trying to portray. This allows children to visualize and explore complex emotions in an accessible way. This is an especially helpful activity to do with younger children who don’t yet have the vocabulary to articulate their emotions. During interactive play with my children, we incorporate these types of exchanges to help them become more familiar with emotions.I also found that telling my kids stories at bedtime was a good way to explore their emotions. Oftentimes, they would be able to connect with what the different characters were experiencing — so when they couldn’t say exactly what they were feeling, they would be able to tell me which character they felt like.While discussing mental health with young children is an intimidating task, finding ways to demonstrate, label and unpack specific feelings sets them up to find better coping mechanisms and strategies.As many parents know, children often learn by imitating the people around them. I first noticed this when my son began repeating some of the words I would say. He would copy the way his dad reacts when watching sports. This kind of behavior was cute. However, I also noticed that when he was sad, he would try to hide in a corner, far away from everyone else. When he was scared, he would let his emotions take over him instead of coming to us for help.I eventually realized that my son was mirroring our behavior. When I had panic attacks, I would often “ride out the wave” instead of practicing grounding techniques. If I had a depressive episode, I would shut everyone out and “deal with it” on my own. Amy Morin, psychotherapist and author of “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,” notes that the habits we cannot break often hold us from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, for instance, can hold us back. While I knew this in theory, seeing my son do the same things opened my eyes to the fact that I had to take better care of myself to show him how he can navigate difficult emotions.From then on, I paid close attention to my own behavior and developed coping mechanisms. I found that watching comfort movies helped when I was in a bad state and being around people I love made me feel more at ease when I was anxious. Slowly but surely, my son started to cope in these ways as well. Now, both my children come to us when they are struggling. By caring for myself, I have taught my children to prioritize self-care and asking for help.Mental health can be an unfamiliar or sensitive topic, even for young children. Often, this discomfort keeps children from expressing their feelings or asking for help. I found that cultivating a safe space at home, as advised by UNICEF, helped my children feel like they were free to express their emotions and feel heard without judgment. Moreover, this foundation will help them to grow up with fewer doubts about seeking help for their mental health. I always try my best to listen and validate what my kids are feeling by listening, accepting and offering advice if they ask for it.A safe space can also include check-ins to establish trust and communication. I would take my son out for a drive (so he would feel safe doing a familiar activity), and we would talk about what problems he was facing that week. Even when there weren’t any, he felt heard and understood, and I had reassurance that he was ok.With my younger daughter, I took her to parks where she would tell me about her day while I pushed her on the swings. This made the interaction feel more casual and inviting, which encouraged her to share more. However, it is important that when you are attempting this with your kids, you should not push boundaries or force them to speak when they are uncomfortable. Cultivating a safe space means there is no pressure.As the mental health conversation evolves, it's time for more people to get comfortable with (and diligent about) addressing this topic with their kids. Judith Warner, journalist and bestselling author of “And Then They Stopped Talking to Me: Making Sense of Middle School,” points out that most modern parents are increasingly aware of mental health issues because they grew up with other people talking about them, which lessened the stigma surrounding mental health and helped promote interventions.These conversations are essential for our children’s health and eventually, the direction of societal attitudes about mental health. By taking an open, proactive and empathetic approach, I have been able to teach my children how to recognize and handle emotions, but also how to feel confident addressing mental health head-on.Alicia Maddox is a mental health advocate who is working toward a graduate degree in psychology.

      "body": "This past Christmas, my husband gave me a journal to write down my dreams, goals and daily meditations. I filled almost every page, but I didn’t write about my dreams or goals. Instead, I wrote apologies to my son. I wrote so much that my hands needed ice packs. I dug down deep. I went through the ink of two pens. Apologies are like the decision to paint your house pink — go big or go home.Then I wrapped a sparkly bow around the journal and headed to a coffee shop to meet my estranged son, who is 21 years old. He’s not a little boy anymore; he is now on his own, living his life in a city far away from me. And he hates me for missing his cries for mental health help when he was growing up. By missing these signs, he says, I disciplined him harshly for things he could not control — and, in turn, warped his sense of self.Deep breaths, I reminded myself. Because this was hard. I hadn’t heard from him in two years, but it had been at least three since I’d recognized him. Somewhere around the time he turned 20, I saw a complete personality change. Parts of him that used to seem like eccentric traits we could make room for, now seemed cruel. His eyes changed, and where they once held the kindness of a little boy, now held the decisions of a man.I waited in the coffee shop for him. He was late. Again. Then he came. At least he came.Thin, I thought. He still looked thin. I wondered if he still forgot to eat.We did not embrace. It had been two years, after all.This meeting brought up complex feelings because my son was not the only one in pain. Underneath my unconditional love for my son lies the trauma of raising him. After all, I’m human, too.And it was hard. He was hard.According to everyone, my son was a troublemaker. He had quirks that people deemed distasteful: His hyper fixation on things, his hygiene issues, the not sleeping enough, the sleeping too much, the piano playing that went on all day long.Moreover, I didn’t want to hand my child over to the trained professionals — people who I didn’t know and who didn’t love him. Because I was afraid they would hurt him, not help him. Because I thought I knew best.I didn’t miss his cries for help, as my son claims; I heard them. But I thought love would be enough to address his challenges. I thought a happy family, good schools, healthy foods, piano lessons, a fluffy dog and family who cared would be enough. But this approach ignored some painful realities.So why didn’t I get my own son the help he needed?Images of what could happen to my son if I reached out for help for him ranged from giant orderlies with menacing smiles who would overly restrain him with straight jackets to doctors who would drug him and destroy his brilliant mind.“I’m sorry for raising you in the Baptist Church,” I had written in the journal. “I’m sorry for every pastor who ever told you that you were bad. I’m sorry for the days I spanked you instead of held you. I’m sorry for not getting you the help you needed, and for what that did to your sense of self. I’m sorry for everything that ever made you believe you were bad, weird, stupid or flawed, when you were just a kid who needed help.”I watched him read the journal and hoped, once again, that love was enough. He took his time reading it, about two hours, and considered every word. He closed it and thanked me for writing it and said he would never forget where he came from, or all the good we did for him, but that I was a bug. I was a brain eating bug, who crawls around the earth eating his brain with my venom.  I quietly said, “I’m so sorry.” And I got up and left him there because there was nothing more I could say.We’ve come so far in our discussion and understanding about mental health in the last 20 years. What I can say now is that I am so sorry for the scars on his heart that have my name on them. I tried to be the orderly, the doctor, the nurse, the therapist, the teacher and the coach. But maybe, just maybe, had I trusted and sought out available help for him, I wouldn’t have needed to fill an entire journal with apologies. And maybe one day he will have the heart to forgive me.Lisa Campbell is a nurse practitioner and writer.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "It was early fall, just past the autumnal equinox, that the fires started. Winds pushed flames through the sunburnt, thirsty hills of Southern California, and it was the ash — gray flakes floating like snowflakes covering the surface of the earth — that I remember most clearly. I remember my own mental state much less clearly. Amid the fires, my mind was ablaze, and reality was slipping away at exponential speed as my first weeks of high school came and passed. Yet, I did not have the recognition nor the language to describe my illness at the time.I felt as though my mind’s ties to reality were cut — and it was there, in a state of confused limbo, that I did not question the day when the high school secretary called over the PA system for Alexandra Shall to come to the office. My mom told me I would be spending “a few days of rest” in the hospital. For some, such a proposition might have evoked fear; but for me, the ability to lay in a bed, as I imagined, sounded divine.The neuropsychiatric institute was not a bed, and it was not a few days. The intake included an excruciating litany of questions. The physical exam, unwanted. Hours later, I sat on a bed dressed in a thin white blanket, clothes and sanitary pads laid bare next to me, much as I felt. The next five weeks were terrifying, and, as I would learn, they came to define the course my life would take over the coming years — the years until now, at the age of 33.There are remnants I recall during the course of my six hospitalizations from October 2013 to June 2014: when I was moved to the bed across from the nurses’ station due to safety concerns; when I was confined to bed for three days for repeated incidents of self-harm within the hospital; when my roommate played explicit rap music loudly in the middle of the night to help her sleep while it forced me to stay awake; when I watched another patient have a seizure on the volleyball court after starting an antidepressant; when, for five weeks, I ate a small piece of fried chicken breast and two scoops of mashed potatoes every night for dinner, both of which proved catastrophic for my digestion; playing cards and ping pong with psych techs and other patients as if our circumstances were ordinary and not of concern; when I saw a psych tech sneak one of my Reese’s Peanut Butter cups from the patient belongings cabinet in the kitchen; watching my little mini dixie cup of pills increase in fullness as the weeks and months passed.During my first hospitalization, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Years later, my symptoms would be reclassified as bipolar 1 disorder, rapid cycling with mixed episodes. To describe this period of my life as “an adolescence, interrupted” is quite an understatement. Every thread in the fabric of my life changed.While my teen years felt like being shuffled through a revolving door of hospitalizations and medications, the experiences I had and the emotions I felt were transformative, and not something I would trade, even considering the pain.Early on, I developed a deep empathy — an ability to understand the pain of others, whether it be physical, mental or emotional. Mental illness is not a solitary experience; rather it affects individuals, families and loved ones. Learning to come to a place of peace, love and forgiveness is healing on all ends.For children and teens with mental health conditions, the road to recovery may be short or it may be long. It is unpredictable, and no one can claim to foresee what comes ahead; so much of life is unknown. Learning to live with discomfort, to find happiness within that discomfort and to approach life from a place of empathy for yourself and others can be sources of strength as you walk the path toward recovery.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "My seven-year-old daughter Isla has big emotions. There is nothing wrong with that, but sometimes, as any parent would, I worry about her worries.Isla becomes anxious before big events (normal) or when being separated from me and my husband (also normal), but this year I started to notice some behavioral changes that signaled something more serious than everyday worries.Once, she sneaked food out of the pantry to eat alone, which worried me because I have an eating disorder. She also began to beg to stay home from school almost every day, and sometimes, these moments would turn into huge crying fits during which she screamed at me. When she went to school, she ended up in the nurse’s office every day until her teacher wouldn’t give her a pass.When her teacher talked to me, I stiffened up. When I was younger, a bit older than Isla now, I would go to the nurse’s office. I wasn’t sick, but I knew that by asking, I could have my mom or grandmother take me home. The nurse called my mom one day and said she thought I had school phobia, a term used for an anxious child who refuses to go to school or avoids school. It turns out that nurse was on to something — I did have a mental health condition (later, I would learn that my behaviors were symptoms of depression and anxiety).As the concerning behavior continued, I asked my therapist about getting help for Isla, and eventually, I was able to get her an appointment with a play therapist, who would be able to communicate with and evaluate Isla through play. I believed my daughter was exhibiting signs of a classic case of anxiety.During our appointment, the therapist asked me, “Do you think this is Isla’s anxiety or possibly your anxiety you’re projecting on to her?”I answered her right away: “Yes, 100%.” I’m so scared that my kids will inherit my mental health conditions, that I have begun to overanalyze their behavior. I can’t help it.The play therapist then told me it was too early to worry based on Isla’s history, and that kids tend to repeat behaviors that have a favorable outcome like coming home after a trip to the nurse — so the repeated nurse’s office visits weren’t necessarily a concern. I accepted this answer. It made sense, especially coming from a trained professional.Despite the therapist’s reassurance, I started to worry about my daughter again. Was I projecting? Or was something wrong?It took a lot of thinking, but finally, I arrived at what was really bothering me.I was worried Isla would turn out like me, meaning she would struggle with multiple mental health conditions. I feared that she might have to fight hard for the right medications and appropriate therapies — that she would have to fight for anything at all.My fears also stemmed from my concerns about how the pandemic has affected my children. They are under an enormous amount of stress, and I feel like they’ve been shortchanged; in many ways, they’ve had to grow up quickly as they absorbed the trauma of a global disaster.The pandemic’s effect on this generation’s childhoods is simply unfair. And this upheaval has compounded an already existing youth mental health crisis.While I hold resentments about how my own childhood mental health situation was handled, I can use it as motivation to do better for the next generation. I can’t go back and change things, but what I can do is advocate for both my children. I try hard not to overanalyze and worry about Isla and my son, but the worrying never stops when you’re a parent, especially a parent with anxiety. Still, I owe them my best efforts.Part of this effort includes remembering that Isla isn’t me. Just because I struggled at a young age doesn’t mean she will. Sometimes, I think that maybe I went through those years to be able to help Isla. If nothing else, I know how to be an advocate and prioritize self-care.Maybe my daughter won’t have any mental health conditions. Maybe she’ll have a care-free childhood (post-COVID-19) and learn how to tolerate distress. If she does develop a mental health condition, it’s out of my control, and I’m not at fault. All I can do is be the best parent I can, be supportive of my kids, teach them healthy coping skills and hope for the best.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "In 1995, when I was a 30-year-old basketball coach at the University of Maine, I received a diagnosis that changed my life forever. After living with bipolar disorder, and overcoming its hurdles for the last 26 years, I have come to recognize the importance of support, community and, more recently, the opportunity for advocacy.It is no secret that we have a lot to address when it comes to the mental health challenges and the needs of our population. These issues are evident at every level of our society. High-profile stories involving Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles and Calvin Ridley this year, each of whom took a timeout to address their own mental health battles, demonstrate how mental illness can impact anyone — across all spectrums of race, gender and economic status — and in any place, time or circumstances.After witnessing the devastating effects of untreated mental illness, I stepped aside from the basketball arena, and I decided to become a different type of coach: one devoted to fighting the stigmas surrounding mental illness. Here are my thoughts on how to fight change the conversation about mental health.We can transform societal attitudes about mental illness early on. Indeed, mental health has the potential to be part of a wider core curriculum. As a former coach, I would love to see classes in mental wellness and training in suicide prevention become common and required coursework in the way that physical education has been for over a century.This could include broader range of psychology courses and health courses added to departments’ offerings. I would also hope to see educators proactively teaching about mental illness as a subject matter; this approach would allow young people to have an understanding of mental health conditions beyond surface-level familiarity.Personally, I enjoyed engaging students through several coaching philosophies and principles. Immediacy, intelligence and intensity are tools commonly used by professionally trained therapists that can help teach young people to prioritize their mental health. By encouraging students to think in the present, to manage and express their feelings and to be bold in sharing their experiences, coaches can empower their players to take ownership of their emotional well-being.College campuses are currently ground zero for discussion and debate on how to approach mental health. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college students in the U.S.On campus, some of the most impactful and influential people are coaches, professors and mentors. These positions can come up with innovative ways to reach our peers, players or students to encourage them to share what may be troubling them and to seek professional help when they it.Mentoring relationships can help young people who feel alone by providing reassurance and safe spaces to explore new ideas and grow without fear of judgement.So, what can you do? It is important that we demand greater resources, not just on campuses, but also for underserved communities struggling with their own battles. We must continue to educate lawmakers about mental health programs, push for greater funding in budgets and lobby insurance companies to recognize mental health treatments more widely.And how do we help people who are struggling with their mental health?We must find ways to be open and honest about our experiences — and, in turn, we must be able to listen the stories of other lived experiences without judgement. Changing our individual behavior to model the changes we want to see is a necessary first step. Moreover, we must not be afraid to act, sometimes swiftly, to get help for someone in need.Philosophy matters. Choice, not chance, will and must determine the future conversation surrounding mental illness. We must make different choices in our education system to teach a topic that all students will encounter in their lives.\n\nJoanne P.

      "body": "It is not uncommon for people to have an experience where they are left feeling distressed. Oftentimes, the event can be so traumatizing that it causes us to feel stressed for days, weeks, months — and sometimes even years — after it took place.Traumatic stress can manifest in a few ways emotionally, physically and mentally. Accordingly, it’s important to know what it can look like in these three different forms.If you have experienced a traumatic event, and are grappling with traumatic stress, your emotions may become extremely intensified. This could include: having frequent anger outbursts, the onset of panic attacks or even feelings of great sadness and loss.Another way traumatic stress manifests emotionally is when people disconnect from their emotions entirely and feel numb to new events or stimuli. This is a protective response to prevent their nervous system from getting overloaded.Due to heightened emotions, one may experience physical symptoms of traumatic stress. This can appear in a variety of ways throughout the body. Some people may experience shallow or rapid breathing, chest pain or headaches. Others report having tense muscles or feeling tense throughout the body or find themselves restless and having difficulty relaxing and sitting still.While some people feel physical tension or pain throughout the body, this is not the case for everyone. Some may find themselves on the opposite of the spectrum; oftentimes, people find themselves feeling completely physically disconnected.It's not uncommon for someone experiencing traumatic stress to zone out and feel as though they are not connected to their physical body or the world around them. This can also be accompanied by a dulling of the five senses (smell, touch, taste, hearing and sight). Some individuals feel as if their bodies are weightless — or they  experience lightheadedness and dizziness.Traumatic stress also impacts how we feel cognitively. When experiencing symptoms of traumatic stress mentally, one may have racing thoughts focused on the present (and how to navigate the traumatic situation), the future (due to their vision of now being doubted) or towards whatever is causing them traumatic stress.Alternatively, one may have brain fog and not be able to access words or thoughts. This may look like an individual being very confused or experiencing some memory loss. Some people have difficulty describing or recognizing their emotions. This is the brain’s way of trying to protect the body. It will try to shut down any “unnecessary” activity in order to focus on scanning for danger and safety.When experiencing traumatic stress, it is important to relax and ground your mind and body to make yourself feel safe. Utilizing grounding or mindfulness techniques or interventions help regulate the body and send messages to the brain saying, “I am safe.” Practicing these interventions allow the brain and body to focus on the present moment instead of the past traumatic experience that is causing us stress. NAMI offers several strategies to help individuals cope with traumatic stress. Some effective methods include:5 - Look: Look around for five things you can see and say them out loud.4 - Feel: Pay attention to your body, think of four things you can feel and say them out loud.3 - Listen: Listen for three things you can hear (traffic, birds chirping, etc.) and say them out loud.2 - Smell: Say two things you can smell. If you can't smell anything at the moment, name your two favorite smells out loud.1 - Taste: Say one thing you taste. If you can't taste anything, name your favorite thing to taste.Breathe in through your nose to a count of four. Hold it for two. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. By doing this you are activating the part of your nervous system that helps your body calm itself.Ultimately, traumatic stress can have a lasting impact on us. It can affect our brains, bodies and how we respond to stressors after a traumatic event — on an emotional, physical and mental level. These manifestations of traumatic stress can range from mild to severe, but regardless of intensity, symptoms can be managed. If you are struggling, try utilizing grounding techniques and mindfulness activities to cope and move forward.Brent Metcalf is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker practicing at Tri-Star Counseling, LLC in Johnson City, Tenn.

      "body": "The other day, I was out at a restaurant, and I heard a table of people discussing high blood pressure. It started when someone said they had gone to the doctor that day and learned they had high blood pressure. Another person said, “I do too,” and named the medication their doctor prescribed. A third person at their table added that their father had high blood pressure, determined to be a symptom of heart disease — and now he is eating better and exercising.So, why are we not hearing these dinnertime conversations about mental health?The reason we don’t often hear conversations about mental health and mental illness is because many people are uncomfortable addressing the topic. It is normal to be concerned about, or even afraid of, things that are uncertain or unfamiliar. But if we take the time to learn about mental health, and the prevalence of mental illness, we will all feel more comfortable talking about it. Perspective is key.To get a better understanding of how mental illness is present in our lives (whether we know it or not), I like to offer the following example: When you are in a public place or space you frequent often, like your church or a store, look around you. Statistically, one in five of the people you see may have dealt with anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions in the last year. Someone you may have seen every week for years may have mental illness, and you would not even know it.Another reason we don’t hear dinner-table conversations about mental health comes down to a lack of education and awareness. Many people experience mental health conditions, but often invalidate their own experiences, or are unaware that what they are experiencing is a symptom of mental illness.I have heard people say, “Oh, I don’t have a mental health condition, I just have some anxiety,” or, “I’ve just been down lately.” Of course, some experiences consistent with mental illness are simply normal reactions to difficult circumstances, but at what point do these feelings become symptoms and signal a need for treatment? Education about when feelings and behaviors need medical attention will be a critical step in changing the conversation. More people will get the help they need when they understand their own bodies and minds.Ultimately, we must remember that mental health is health. Mental health conditions, like high blood pressure, are treatable medical conditions. People with mental illness can — and do — live normal and very productive lives. A quick glance at the news will remind us of this; many successful CEOs, Olympic athletes, famous entertainers and prolific artists live with mental health conditions and continue to achieve their goals and find happiness.May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Let’s take it upon ourselves to learn the facts about mental health. Let’s challenge ourselves to examine our beliefs and educate ourselves.I’d like to encourage people to use this awareness month to start a discussion with someone. You can start a conversation by saying:If we hope to move forward and reach a place where we no longer have to envision 767 buses of preventable tragedies, we need to make changes.

      "body": "Recently I was watching one of my favorite movies, “A Few Good Men.” I had been a fan of the movie, a legal drama about marines, even before I joined the army. It features incredible performances from its A-list cast and a good “twist and turn” storyline. At one point in the movie, two marines participate in a hazing incident in which they are ordered to put a tainted rag down another marine’s throat and tape his mouth shut.As I watched, in my mind, I was transported back to a night in the desert when I was in the army, and I had a similar, horrible experience. I try not to dwell on this traumatic event in my life. I quickly turned off the television, but the thoughts of my own encounter came roaring back, and I found myself experiencing the incident all over again.Even when my trauma first happened, it was so profound, I did not know how to manage it. What I experienced was the last thing I imagined I would endure during my service. Even retelling the story spurs racing thoughts and a mountain of anxiety: I felt the tight restraint of duct tape being wrapped around my body until I was lying on the ground, unable to move in any direction to defend myself against my fellow soldiers. The duct tape was strapped across my mouth, and I was having difficulty breathing.I remember thinking, “how could this be happening to me?” I was sure I was experiencing the last moments of my life. My parents flashed across my mind — would they ever know the truth about what had happened to me in this desolate, lonely place?Seeing the hazing incident in a movie brought about a PTSD flashback. I looked down at the bracelet on my left wrist. It had the phone number of the veteran’s crisis line. Maybe they could help?I also remembered that I had planned and prepared for a situation like this. Because of my diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, I developed a routine I could follow on stressful days or days when I am experiencing PTSD symptoms. I knew that keeping to my routine was crucial. With the past weighing heavy on my entire body, the part of the body that was taped, I still had to move forward for the rest of the day. My daily routine was the only way I could move on.I began by having coffee while listening to uplifting music. I brushed my teeth. Those two small steps made me proud that I had at least begun my daily routine. However, I still had the rest of the day to get through. I was in “survival mode,” so all I had was my routine.I had not had an episode like that in months. Next, I called my mom, which was also a part of my daily routine. She had always been my go-to for advice and counseling. When I deal with anxiety and my symptoms of schizophrenia, I wonder what I would do if I did not have my parents who are my trust partners in my mental health journey.My mom gave me what I call “sensory therapy.” She asked me to use my senses to tell her what was going on around me.My mom asked, “What do you see?”“My neighbor in his convertible driving in the parking lot.” I answered.  “I see a breeze blowing the palm trees. I love that I live in a place where there are palm trees.”She asked me to close my eyes and tell her what I could hear — a dog barking, traffic out on the highway, seagulls squawking. By doing this, I felt in touch with what is real and what is happening around me. Her voice made me feel safe, and I knew I was not back in the desert.I told mom I was looking forward to my exercise for the day, because it would start to get rid of this heavy and full body anxiety. She told me to call her after my exercise, just to check in.Exercise is a regular part of my daily routine. I do it six times a week. Without exercise, racing thoughts and anxiety would fester and envelop my mind. Exercise not only burns off my calories, but also burns away excessive thinking and worrying.Ultimately, I learned that watching an intense movie has become a trigger for me, even though I consider myself to be in recovery. I learned that my routine is crucial to distract myself from thinking I have no control. In the end, I had my action plan: my trust partner, my routine and my self-care. All of these have become imperative for a successful mental health journey— and I hope it can do the same for others.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, SC where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

      "body": "“Why didn't I see this coming?” is a question that many parents may ask themselves. As a mother and a psychologist, I often wondered why I did not identify my son's early symptoms of schizophrenia. The difficulty for me, like most parents, is that early symptoms of schizophrenia often masquerade as other issues, like depression.Unless you have a first degree relative with schizophrenia, and know that this illness is a possible inheritance, schizophrenia is not really a “go-to” diagnosis. And, as important as it is to diagnosis schizophrenia early, identifying the early signs can be very difficult.The best thing a parent or caretaker can do is to make sure that any early symptoms are treated professionally. Then as the psychotic symptoms become apparent, and the diagnosis becomes clear, interventions for schizophrenia are more readily accessible because the person has already engaged in treatment.During most of his childhood my son, Jacob, loved spending time with friends and always made new ones when we vacationed — and he was never at a loss for energy. However, during his sophomore year in high school, these behaviors slowly began to change. He started struggling to find a good fit with friends and became somewhat argumentative with his fellow percussionist in marching band. I labeled this change as “teen angst.” I thought that with some guidance and experience, he would outgrow this phase.Jacob’s “teen angst” continued to grow, and he began to require psychological and medical help for depression. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), one of the early signs of schizophrenia in about 50% of the cases is depression. This was true in our family’s situation; Jacob was diagnosed and treated for depression several years before he exhibited any obvious symptoms of schizophrenia.His depression spanned the last two to three years of high school. He met regularly with a psychologist and eventually took anti-depressants prescribed by a psychiatrist. He was able to manage his academics and enjoy after-school and church-related activities, but he was not his usual social self. Even with medication, he would sleep excessively. During one mission trip, he spent a whole day sleeping in the back of the van while everyone else was building a deck for a needy family. During a marching band trip to California, he slept through a tour of Hollywood until I was able to wake him up and urge him to join his friends. On the same trip, he fell asleep on the bus to Six Flags and woke up at the bus terminal.Excessive sleeping and social withdrawal were key symptoms of his “depression,” but as I realized later, they can also be possible symptoms of schizophrenia. I didn’t think of it because many adolescents experience depression. According to a 2020 survey by SAMSHA, 4.3 million adolescents between 12 and 17 or 17% of US teens were diagnosed with a major depressive episode. Since schizophrenia impacts between 1 to 2% of the population in general, not all people with depression later develop schizophrenia. So how do you know if your son, daughter or loved one who is depressed will later have schizophrenia? That prediction is very difficult, if not impossible, most of the time.Jacob, however, did show some of other early warning signs, such as thought disorder — a disorganized way of thinking that manifests in abnormal ways of expressing oneself when speaking and writing. During the first semester of his senior year in high school, and about three months before his official diagnosis of schizophrenia, Jacob’s creative writing teacher asked to meet with me. She was concerned about his writing because he kept qualifying his statements with asides in parenthesis. She said that she had talked to him about his use of parentheses, but he continued to use them anyway. She couldn't figure out why he was so resistant to her instructions.When I looked at what he had been doing, I quickly rationalized his style to be related to one of his favorite television programs at the time, Mystery Science Theater. It was a popular program that showed movies with a group of characters taking the part of critics and making funny asides or additions to the scripts. That was certainly an easy conclusion for me to make until I discovered a green spiral notebook in his room titled “My Schizophrenic Notebook.” He, again, used parentheses, but this time it was apparent that his thinking was very disorganized. Unlike some people with his diagnosis, his verbal expression was never noticeably disturbed — but his writing showed obvious evidence of thought disorder.Jacob displayed other “odd” behaviors in his early teens, but they were usually short-lived. Several times, he exhibited brief catalepsy or wooden posturing (one of many manifestations of catatonia). Each time, the behavior seemed to correspond with excessive stress. The third and last time lasted about one hour following the small wedding ceremony for me and his stepfather. Pictures show him sitting on a couch outside the sanctuary in a wooden pose and a distant expression on his face. One of his grandmothers commented that her husband (Jacob’s grandfather) had similar experiences after he returned home from battle following World War II.While Jacob had a good relationship with his new stepfather, he may have been traumatized by the major change in our family structure. Still, it was an unusual reaction. His grandmother's comment was a logical but unexpected explanation. Since I had known his grandfather for many years and had never seen any signs of psychosis, I tucked the experience away in the back of my mind hoping it would not occur again, which it never did. Catatonia is, however, a common symptom among those hospitalized with schizophrenia.As strange as some of these events were, they did not prepare us for what was to come. Most of the time, even with depression and the few odd behaviors, Jacob looked and acted like most other teenagers. He attended school, worked part-time at a local grocery store, enjoyed playing his drums and participated in school and family events. Any other symptoms of schizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations, that he may have had before his diagnosis were easily masked by his composure.Looking back, the only way to tie these unusual events together as prodromal (or early symptoms of schizophrenia) would have been to know that he had a genetic predisposition. That knowledge did not come to light until later.Jacob had a psychologist to help him with what seemed to be developmental issues related to being a teenager. Later he needed help for what looked like depression so we added a psychiatrist for medication. Because of these interventions, his psychotic symptoms were addressed as soon as they were recognized. Hopefully, in the future, more definitive methods of early identification will be available.Linda Snow-Griffin, Ph.D. is a retired psychologist from Cincinnati, a mental health advocate and an author.

      "body": "It’s 11 a.m. on a warm and sunny October day. I am sitting in a chair, listening to a conversation between two people. One of them is my mentor, a psychologist with a specialty in clinical psychology, and the other is a voluntary participant in a clinical research study. We’re in an office space on the 22nd floor of a hospital building.My chair is leaning against the wall, and my black tea is sitting conveniently to my right on a small rectangular table. To my left is a small, bare window that offers a view of the blue sky and distant tall buildings. The room is bland, unattractive and poorly lit. As I continue listening to the conversation happening around me, I suddenly begin to feel discomfort.The feeling of discomfort grows exponentially in a matter of seconds; my pulse quickens, my heart races, my body shakes and my temperature rises. I know I have to do something. My breathing becomes shallow, I start sweating profusely and I begin to feel faint. Now I know I really must do something. I’m worried that I might be gasping for air very soon. To cope, I start looking around for exits, mentally tracing the various ways that will get me out of the building fast.I note that the stairway is the best option as I certainly can’t use the elevators and risk being stuck in one. Then, I remember the window. At that moment, I feel instant relief set in, knowing that if I need air, I can just open the window. My heart stops racing, and my breathing normalizes. In the clarity of my relief, I can now identify the episode as a panic attack.A panic attack does not last very long; episodes may only last a few minutes, but due to the intensity of the experience, after the body goes back to “normal,” people often feel depleted of all their energy. In some cases, people’s legs feel wobbly and can’t sustain the weight of their bodies. Sometimes, people notice that their bodies continue to shake, and their thinking becomes clouded and confused.Personally, I’ve found that the aftermath of a panic attack sometimes lasts longer than the episode itself. Accordingly, I will go to great lengths to avoid anything that could trigger another episode.After a panic attack happens, the brain forms an association between its occurrence and the context of the episode (whereabouts, companions, current activities etc.). This process leads to an automatic avoidance response to the site or context in which the panic attack occurred, whether it’s a particular street, a certain comment or a specific activity.Once formed, the mental association reinforces the avoidance behavior, which means that a reminder of where or how panic attack occurred — or even thinking about it, in more extreme cases — could cause another panic attack. Moreover, the very act of avoiding the context in which the panic attack occurred further solidifies the mental association, creating a vicious loop.While panic attacks result in similar symptoms for most people, the actual experience of a panic attack is different for everyone and really determines how we react going forward — and how we can cope.Living with anxiety and panic disorders is difficult; sometimes, it can feel like symptoms are affecting every area of life. At the height of my anxiety attacks, I had to make quite a few lifestyle changes to avoid triggers and overwhelming myself, including spending less time out with my friends, putting aside my studies and taking on fewer responsibilities at work. I also made a few positive changes, like practicing meditation on a regular basis, eating healthy meals and exercising. These changes and new routines were the driving force behind my recovery.Ultimately, I’ve found that the key to overcoming my anxiety is systematic lifestyle changes and perseverance. Once I implemented these changes, I stuck to them and followed them diligently. I found resources online, as well as tips and guidance from practitioners and peers alike. Today, I can say I am free of panic attacks, and my anxiety no longer controls my life. \n\n\nYasmina Rebani-Lee co-founded Mindriselife.org to help other people with anxiety find resources and support to help them overcome their anxiety.

      "title": "The “Model Minority” Stereotype Prevents AAPI From Seeking Mental Health Care",

      "body": "For many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), the experience of being a racial minority in the U.S. is largely informed by the “model minority” stereotype, a cultural expectation that their demographic will achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success. Specifically, this stereotype suggests that Asian Americans best embody the “American Dream” with an incredibly strong work ethic and inherent intelligence.Accordingly, Asian American students find themselves pressured to attend prestigious universities and pursue esteemed careers (often in law, medicine or engineering). Indeed, AAPI are often perceived as the model of prestige and socioeconomic success.This stereotype is harmful for several reasons as it:Specifically, these cultural expectations have ramifications for the mental health of AAPI and their ability to seek appropriate care. The consequences are dire; according to The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), suicide is the second leading cause of death among Asian American young adults.As I have reflected on my own experience, and learned more about mental health, I have come to believe that addressing the mental health crisis requires understanding the specific ways in which the model minority stereotype prevents AAPI from seeking help for their mental health.The widely perpetuated model minority stereotype often plays out in family dynamics, and in turn, impacts how people address their mental health. For example, respect for the immigrant experience is central to many AAPI households — many of us are made aware of the family sacrifices and hardships that led to a better and successful life in the U.S. Often, this reverence for resilience and strength discourages the sharing of emotions; talking about mental health, in some families, is considered weak and a modern “luxury.”While the conversation surrounding mental health is slowly changing in the U.S., and efforts to destigmatize mental illness are encouraging a cultural shift — I have noticed in the AAPI community that struggles with mental health are scoffed at and brushed off as entitlement.Additionally, I have found that AAPI are often raised to conceal their emotions as a defense against the discrimination and racism they will face. Ultimately, this causes a fear of vulnerability and any perceived failure. As a result, many AAPI are uncomfortable with disclosing their mental health struggles, fearing they will disappoint family members and deviate from the model minority standard.Even when services are made available, how does one advocate for oneself when their upbringing has enforced the need to prioritize their family’s happiness over their own? While resources are available, the information provided doesn’t always provide specific steps to disclosing a mental health issue or explain the basics (for example, the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist or a standard price for treatment).These are possible reasons why AAPI are hesitant to seek support; often, the steps toward self-care are overwhelming and unfamiliar. Many wonder if they even have the time to seek help.Addressing mental health conditions and getting on the path toward recovery is a gradual process that requires patience, especially for those of us who are also unlearning cultural norms. Taking the first steps toward healing is one of many difficulties AAPI face because our culture has taught us that prioritizing one’s personal needs is selfish. Moreover, few people are willing to risk the social and even professional repercussions of deviating from the model minority stereotype to seek help.However, for those who are ready to take this step, there are resources available.Many individuals may prefer to see an AAPI therapist to begin their journey toward healing. If the resources above are still overwhelming, reading AAPI written blogs, finding social media posts and watching YouTube videos about mental health within the AAPI community are other alternatives. Hearing AAPI experiences is another way to begin validating your own experiences. Self-care isn’t selfish or a sign of weakness; rather, it primes us for empowerment and resilience.Phoebe Castillo Chua is a UC Davis alumna working under the Stanford School of Medicine’s LEAP program to improve the health of Bay Area communities.

      "body": "Early warning signs often emerge at the onset or worsening of mental illness symptoms. Simply, put these warning signs are any thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that significantly impair day-to-day functioning — such as feeling excessively sad or low — and they may indicate you need help.Understandably, if you are experiencing unusual thoughts and feelings, you may prefer to ignore them or expect them to pass, but ultimately, it is in your best interest to address them as soon as possible. Otherwise, these feelings and behaviors could lead to worsening symptoms, an episode, relapse or even self-harm.Here are a few considerations to help you address your own warning signs.To keep your mental health in check, you need to determine your baseline — how you are feeling and behaving on a good day, a normal day and a bad day. Early warning signs are typically deviations from your baseline, often starting with small changes, like minor sleep interruptions.You’ll also want to recall any past experiences of mental health struggles or episodes. Were there any changes in your thoughts and behaviors prior to the episode? What did they signal? How did you address them? What were the outcomes? Knowing your past patterns can provide valuable insight into your current situation.Experiencing early warning signs is not necessarily a cause for serious concern, but these signs may warrant monitoring or evaluation by a mental health provider.If you experience what may be an early warning sign and have not been diagnosed with a mental health condition, consider your risk factors for mental illness. These include recent stressful life events (such as a job loss and relationship troubles), genetics and even age (75% of mental illnesses develop by the age of 24).To identify your warning signs, pay close attention to your thoughts, moods, physical symptoms and behavior. They may occur independently or in combination. Warning signs could manifest as changes in emotions — including feelings of low self-esteem, uncertainty, worry, hopelessness, fear, irritability or anger. These can lead to withdrawal and isolation.Warning signs could also manifest in physical changes, like a reduced need for sleep, increased activity and restlessness, sweating, rapid breathing, fatigue or back pain. When evaluating your situation, it’s important to note that these symptoms vary by condition. For example, a reduced need for sleep is often a warning sign for bipolar disorder and fatigue is a common warning sign for depression.Once you determine what warning sign you are experiencing, it is important to note whether the symptom was triggered by something, such as a breakup, or appeared without a clear explanation. If it was triggered by a particular event, you may be able to address the situation through problem-solving or emotion-solving coping strategies.Pay close attention to the impact of each early warning sign on your ability to function and perform daily tasks, grading each one from one to 10 in severity. Quickly progressing and sudden onset of symptoms may indicate that the situation is more concerning. Keep a daily record and be ready to share observations with a supporter or health care provider.Having a plan to address your symptoms and specific needs will allow you to move forward more effectively when warning signs emerge. Importantly, your plan should include alternate ways to perform daily activities that may be impacted; for example, you may need to secure work accommodations. You’ll want the plan to include:There are various coping strategies to address symptoms and your reactions to them. It may help to ask friends, family members and health care providers for their recommendations (but note that each person will have different strategies and not every strategy will work for you). Also remember that you may have to apply coping strategies for the short-term or long-term. These strategies could include:Ultimately, early warning signs should not be ignored, downplayed or dismissed. They may not go away on their own. They are reminders that we all need to monitor our mental health, no matter how well we think we’re doing. And if they do arise, we can successfully address them if we treat them as the prevention tools that they are.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "As I have learned on my mental health journey, managing and coping with the symptoms of bipolar disorder can be challenging. When I was first diagnosed in my mid-twenties, I struggled to fully accept this new reality; frankly, I barely listened to my doctor explain my diagnosis and treatment plan. I followed the recommended treatment plan for a while, but once I started to feel better, I stopped taking my medication and the symptoms returned.My recovery did not begin until I truly accepted that managing my illness would be a lifelong endeavor — an endeavor that requires paying close attention to my warning signs. Once I came to this realization, my life slowly began to change for the better. Now, I fully understand my symptoms, and I have become in tune to my body; as a result, I can identify the causes and warning signs of a possible episode almost immediately. When I determine that it is going to be a difficult day, I am able to prepare myself and use my coping skills to manage my symptoms.Some possible causes and warning signs of my episodes, which I will share in hopes of helping others recognize their own, include:Almost everyone will deal with some form of stress in their lives, but I’ve learned that stress can impact me differently than those who do not live with my mental health condition. If my body is under a lot of stress — personal, professional or a combination of both — for a long period, I am at a higher risk of mood swings, which can evolve into a manic episode.When I experience prolonged stress, my thoughts will begin to race, and my brain struggles to turn off and rest. When I reach this point, my thoughts are scattered and sometimes even doing the simplest tasks is overwhelming. Naturally, this takes a physical and emotional toll.When I notice that I’m not sleeping well, I start to pay close attention to my mental state. Often, if I’m not sleeping, I find that this is due to racing thoughts consistent with a manic episode. What begins as less frequent sleep can easily turn into staying awake for 24 hours — a clear sign of a manic episode.Of course, this lack of sleep will make my physically tired, but often the most difficult symptom is my mind is unable to rest. I may find myself lying in bed, tossing and turning. Usually, my best coping mechanism is staring at the ceiling and praying I will fall asleep. To avoid these scenarios, I do my best to maintain proper sleep hygiene to keep my physical and mental health in check. For me, this means getting at least eight hours of sleep a night.Over time, I’ve learned that unexpected changes to my routine and care regimen, including medications, can trigger an episode. Recently, I took an over-the-counter allergy pill, and within the next few days, I noticed my moods were changing. I spiraled into a depressive episode in which I cried uncontrollably and had no energy at all. A few days later, I found myself feeling irritable, wanting to spend lots of money and talking a mile a minute.After a few weeks of this pattern, I was able to identify this behavior as a bipolar episode that I would need to “ride out.” As I weathered the onslaught of symptoms, I began to reflect on what I had done differently recently, and I remembered that the only change to my regimen was the allergy pill. So, I stopped taking the pill and replaced it with a different one. Within a few weeks, I was back to my usual self.Over the years, I have learned that I have a “type A personality,” and I thrive when I stick to a rigid schedule. I need this to keep myself in order. I do not like chaos; my house is always clean, and I make appointments well in advance. If my schedule gets rearranged unexpectedly or I fall behind, I may begin to panic and spiral.Unfortunately, this character trait is also accompanied by high expectations of myself and others; I expect people to work at the same level of intensity as I do, which can cause me to have added stress in my professional and personal life, which could potentially trigger an episode. However, to manage my mental health, I do my best to organize the things I can control and try to remain flexible whenever possible.Ultimately, I feel blessed to understand my illness and my body well enough to identify the warning signs of a possible episode. By knowing myself and my mental health condition, I am better equipped to manage and cope with bipolar disorder. This is what helps me to find hope through that storm.Tammy Ozolins is a full time educator, residing in Richmond, Va.

      "body": "Since adolescence, I have prided myself on my resilience, my willingness to serve others and my ability to achieve and persevere through any season of life. Growing up, I was captain of a competitive science team and a member of multiple other academic teams. While I was thriving academically, I struggled with my mental health; I dealt with panic attacks caused by a phobia of food and restaurants.I survived months of semi-starving myself because my body would panic when I tried to eat, and I faced the residual effects for years. But I pushed through these challenges and continued to meet the typical definition of “success.” If I could do this, I reasoned, everything was fine.As I reflect on my mental health journey, I now realize that “functional” and “successful” don’t always mean “healthy.”In October of 2021, just a few months after I graduated college, I jetted off to Spain to pursue a master’s degree and teach English abroad. The first month was wonderful; I settled into my new school and began making friends in my program. But slowly my mental health began to spiral. Before I knew it, I was isolating, losing interest in all hobbies and spending the entire weekend alone in my apartment. I couldn’t even get off of the couch.There was a reason I didn’t see this behavior as a sign of something more serious: Even though I was struggling, I made it to work and class every Monday through Friday, and I spent many days gone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. teaching. Because I was capable of getting up and going to work all of those days — and because I enjoyed much of the time I spent with my students — I concluded nothing was wrong. Truly depressed people can’t get up out of bed and find moments of happiness, right?I soon learned that depression doesn’t always look the way you might expect.It wasn’t until early December, when I self-harmed for the very first time, that I realized I was truly and deeply suffering.I spent the next couple of weeks constantly tugging at my sleeves, making sure that my students never saw my wounds. How do you explain to a child that you hurt yourself on purpose? Ultimately, my concern for my students suppressed my desires to self-harm.The following week, I told myself that I was going to find a therapist, increase my anti-depressant dosage do everything in my power to improve my mental health. I had made a commitment to my students and to my school, and I still had six months of my contract left. But as I made these plans, and rededicated myself to my work, my isolation on the weekends became increasingly worse — and any remnants of motivation disappeared altogether.I was stuck in this nightmarish limbo. Part of me believed that I was capable of staying in Spain for the next six months. I was high functioning, so I knew I’d have no issues making it to school.\nThe other part of me questioned that capability. Yes, you will make it to school, I thought, but is the suffering during the weekend worth it? Will you actually go out and get the help you need?I was distraught by having to make a choice. I loved my school, but I also loved myself. I didn’t want to hurt myself, but I couldn’t control the intrusive thoughts. After weeks and weeks of tears and phone calls with family, friends and my partner, I finally came to a decision. I was coming home.While I was relieved to have arrived at a decision, I still felt like a failure. Why couldn’t the high achieving woman I thought I was get through this? After years of defining myself by my successes, I began to question my worth. Those feelings of inadequacy were crushing, and I am still working through them to this day.The following weeks brought several emotional conversations, the most notable of which was with my school supervisor. During a lunch break one day, in tears, I explained everything that I was going through, and I shared that I had decided to go home. As I spoke, her eyes widened, and she seemed stunned. At the end, she told me: “I had no idea anything was wrong.”From my experience, I have learned that there is no standard image of depression. For those of us with high-functioning depression, we “look ok,” and the people around us don’t know that we’re suffering. We are good at hiding our pain and doing what we’re supposed to — but, as a result, we fly under the radar and can feel even more alone. With some reflection, I have concluded that the best way for me to deal with high-functioning depression is to be open about my mental health and my needs — as difficult as that can be.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "When I was in seventh grade, I started to feel different. My moods changed a lot; I would be fine one minute, then I would be crying and agitated the next. I’m sure the adults in my life thought I was just adjusting to middle school — that the moodiness was a result of turning 13.I remember being overwhelmingly sad, lonely and misunderstood. My sadness was accompanied by intrusive thoughts. Suddenly, horrible notions would parade through my head:Your parents are going to die.\nYou’re going to die.\nSomething bad is going to happen.\nNobody loves you.I didn’t realize that my sadness and intrusive thoughts weren’t normal. The only thing I could do about it, I thought, was pray. Over and over, I’d ask that my thoughts and fears not come true. It became obsessive.As I continued to struggle, I began isolating myself from friends. I also missed a lot of school. When I actually went, I’d ask to go to the nurse so I could call my mom and eventually come home. This happened so frequently that the nurse told my mom I could have school phobia (frequently called school refusal), a term used to describe a child’s severe anxiety about — and resulting avoidance of — attending school. Nothing happened after that call.I continued to miss class and after school activities, even the volleyball games which I’d once loved. I felt enormous guilt about my constant absences, but the relief of staying home was more powerful than the feeling of being around my friends and having fun.Looking back, I can identify those behaviors and feelings as symptoms of depression and an anxiety disorder, but other than one phone call from the school nurse, no one in my life suggested that I needed help. I wish I had spoken up, but I had no idea that what I was experiencing was indicative of a larger problem. As I reflect on my past, I realize just how much early intervention would’ve changed the trajectory of my life.I wasn’t diagnosed with depression or anxiety until I was in college, after my beloved grandmother passed away. I was drowning in grief and went to a college counselor who suggested I find a psychiatrist. As I learned more about depression and anxiety, I realized that I had been battling symptoms since childhood. My Mema’s passing, I realized, was just the final straw. My mental illness had always been there.At first, I didn’t tell anyone that I was seeing a psychiatrist or that I had been prescribed medication. I was embarrassed; I saw how my family members were coping with their grief, and nobody seemed to be struggling the way I was. I dropped two classes, becoming a part-time student. I drove to my parents’ house during the week and on weekends because I needed comfort. I isolated from my roommates and friends, who voiced their concerns, but I couldn’t listen.Eventually, my depression became easier to live with, and I saw it as an inconvenience, rather than an interruption to my everyday life — until years later when I moved away, got married and had children. I experienced severe postpartum depression, and it was more powerful than anything I’d felt before. I had suicidal thoughts, cried all the time and I even started to believe some of my enduring intrusive thoughts. I didn’t feel rational. And I wasn’t. The suicidal thoughts paired with the idea that I wasn’t a good mom. Guilt infiltrated every inch of my body.One night, after a fight with my husband, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and feeling scared for my future. I called my best friend, frantic, begging for help. She urged me to go to the nearest emergency room, so I did.This incident opened my eyes to just how bad my mental health had become. I couldn’t take care of myself. I went weeks without brushing my teeth. Showering was rare, too. It didn’t feel like I was being a good mom, but how could I? I was pouring from an empty cup. Self-care was at the bottom of my to-do list.Eventually I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Houston, Texas, almost four hours away from my family. While I was there, something just clicked. I started to understand my unhealthy coping skills and self-sabotaging behavior. After years of living in denial, I acknowledged my eating disorder, too. I learned about self-care and how to cope when things go wrong.It was like a second chance at life.Now, four years later, I can honestly say I’m in recovery. I’m living my best life and enjoying things I’d taken for granted for years. I still have bad days. I still have horrible days, but now I know how to deal with it. I go to therapy weekly and work with the local chapter of NAMI, NAMI Greater Corpus Christi.Do I wish things had gone differently? Sometimes. I feel like the best version of myself, but it still hurts thinking of that lonely seventh grader begging God not to die. The signs of mental illness were all there, but she stigma of mental illness prevented anyone from noticing or speaking up.Now we know better. I work to end stigma and share my experience so this won’t happen to another little girl. I’ll keep fighting for that seventh grade me until my last breath.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "For most of my life, I have battled depression and mania. There were weeks on end when I could not get out of bed. I would scold myself for not being whatever it was I needed to be that day: a better mother or a better wife. I would also spend weeks or months as an upbeat, fearless, spunky, funny and driven woman — a woman who could command the attention of the room with confidence. There was rarely a middle ground.When these symptoms began, I did not have a specific diagnosis, but I did know something was wrong; a fact, I thought, I was never going to admit to anyone. I had a nice group of friends, and I was afraid of losing them with the news of my mental illness.Despite my insistence on keeping my condition private, I knew just how serious the consequences of mental illness could be. In 2005, my father-in-law was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, stopped taking his medication and ultimately, died by suicide. But I knew I could never take my own life; it would be cruel to allow my husband to lose both a father and a wife to the same fate. I loved him too much to do that to him.In fact, I was angry at my father-in-law when he died. I did not understand why he would choose to leave his family — or why he would create such chaos in his family’s lives. Due to my own internalization of misinformation and sigma surrounding mental illness, I could not empathize with his pain or see his struggles as a result of illness and isolation rather than bad choices.As I have grappled with my own mental health challenges, and witnessed the mental health challenges of those close to me, I have often wondered: does “unconditional love” actually have conditions for those with mental illness? And how can we change this?After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my symptoms escalated, I began to understand my father-in-law’s struggle. He had once described himself as a “shell of a person” — something I had not understood at the time. I never imagined I would know first-hand what that felt like, being a \"shell,\" but I did, 16 years later. In the summer 2021, I was faced with the same alienation and fear of this illness, dealing with it nearly alone, and wholly misunderstood.By the end of June, my symptoms reached the point where I lost touch with reality. My memory of these manic and psychotic episodes is patchy; I know that I did things, but it was as if I was not in control of the reins. Other than short flashes of memory, everything is blank. My behavior, I learned later, included filing an undeserved Protection from Abuse on my husband. Naturally, this caused traumatic upheaval in my family life.My children were deeply upset by my actions, but I did not see any concerning changes in behavior. Even when I saw creatures crawling out of the walls and “zapping” me, I called no one. I would see my children in the house, even though they had chosen to stay with their father.  I'd feel them hugging me and turn to hug them back. Each time, I was reduced to tears because they were not actually there.During this time, I was full of paranoia, fear and anger, and I was filled to the brim with confusion, trying to make sense of reality in complete isolation. The police eventually found me sobbing on my front lawn, screaming that my kids had been kidnapped (by that point I'd spent weeks without them and had no idea that I was the cause of it). The episode culminated with a two-and-a-half-week stay in a psychiatric hospital and months in group outpatient counseling.After my mental health crisis, I faced several challenges. Of course, I had to grapple with the reality of my manic behaviors, but I also had to weather the loss of people who could not accept that I had an illness.Perhaps the most devastating loss was Melanie, my best friend of 30 years. She was angry with me and doubted my illness. \"You are hiding behind this bipolar lie,\" she wrote to me. Then, after being shut out by Melanie, I lost all my friends overnight. As I tried to make sense of this loss, I began to understand the isolation my father-in-law must have felt and the ridicule he likely endured from those he trusted.Now, with the right treatment and medication, I am more emotionally stable. After reflecting on the last year, I have realized something: who I am as a person is not changed by my mental illness. I believe that statement is what we need to start shouting from the rooftops in order to dismantle the stigma of mental illness. A diagnosis (or even a mental health crisis) does not strip us from the good parts of who we are. We are the same people we always were: glorious, fun, driven, intelligent, valuable people.These illnesses do not change who we are and embracing that fact will allow a cultural shift. We are valuable. We should not accept being shunned, nor should we beg those who left us to come back.  These illnesses are a chance for us to rebuild ourselves without those who judge and discard us. It is a chance for us to shine in our lives and finally be happy.Anastasia Leiphart has been a freelance writer for nearly 20 years, and her work has appeared in various trade and commercial publications including “Property and Yacht” and “Today's Modern Teacher.” She now runs a blog called “Razing Rachel,” which tells her story of living with bipolar disorder.

      "body": "As those of us who live with the diagnosis know, schizophrenia is a difficult condition to relate to. Most people can sympathize with someone who is suffering from an evident physical injury, such as a broken leg. They can also understand the plight of someone with a less visible illness, like cancer. Perhaps they haven’t experienced those particular medical issues, but they can imagine the physical pain and conceptualize the fear.On the other hand, a serious mental illness like schizophrenia can be more difficult to imagine, as it affects one’s ability to interpret reality, often without any apparent physical symptoms. Much of the general population will never experience this, nor are they able to imagine battling their own minds in this way.Due to our possible misinterpretations of reality, those of us with schizophrenia may say and do things that seem bizarre to others, further alienating us from other people — even people who wish to help or understand us. For this reason, we suffer an onslaught of stigmatizing assumptions, labeling us “crazy” or “insane” — language with negative connotations that is never used to describe someone healing from a physical problem.The cycle of social stigma and misinformation compounds the already-challenging experience of managing a mental health condition.Awareness of the lived experience of schizophrenia is lacking; a relatively small percentage of Americans feel as if they are familiar with schizophrenia, and many who have heard of the condition are fearful of encountering people with schizophrenia at work or in their personal lives — even those who are undergoing treatment.This stigma is exacerbated by negative press coverage. Often, when someone with schizophrenia appears in the media, it is usually in relation to a violent incident — even though, statistically, people with schizophrenia are less likely to commit violent acts than those who do not have the condition. In fact, people with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims of violence than are members of the general population.With media representations painting a different picture, how is someone who wishes to understand able to set aside the condition’s negative social connotations and lend support? If people continue to see those living with this condition as inherently “crazy” rather than ill, how will we move forward?In addition to combatting the misinformation and misleading representations of schizophrenia, people with the condition often struggle to self-advocate, as they often feel different from the average person. For many of us with schizophrenia, communicating with and persuading a large audience (in hopes of educating about schizophrenia and our lived experience) is difficult and even frightening.Those managing noticeable symptoms fear being seen as “strange,” and we become acutely aware of the ways in which they lack an ability to relate to other people. It often feels as though the mental and emotional functions that allow humans to connect have been set askew in some way.The result of widespread stigma is not simply an unfortunate social experience for those with schizophrenia — it is a life-threatening challenge. The life expectancy of someone with schizophrenia is roughly two decades shorter than that of the general population, arguably due to the prevalence of suicide among people with the condition (specifically among those who do not seek help, fearing stigma and discrimination). Oftentimes, those who die by suicide are considered “high-functioning,” as they are aware that they are sick and can comprehend the extent of their social isolation and perceived dysfunction.But this does not have to be the reality. If we can commit to educating ourselves on the condition, promoting accurate and nuanced representations of schizophrenia and prioritizing advocacy, we may see more favorable times to come.Casey Clabough, who lives with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, is an author and editor.

      "body": "“Two-Pound Baby Wins Life Fight,” was the front-page headline of the Feb. 21, 1962 edition of the Jefferson City, Missouri Post-Tribune. That baby was me, and the story celebrated my release from the hospital after spending months in an incubator struggling to survive.\n\nAt 15 months old, doctors told my parents that I had an intellectual disability. My mother questioned this diagnosis, and she fought to find another answer. Several months later, I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. I experienced a childhood filled with leg braces, painful surgeries and bullying.\n\nAs I got older, my various physical disabilities progressed. I found myself looking for ways to advocate for people with disabilities. Beginning in 2001, I dedicated my time to breaking down barriers surrounding physical disabilities and promoting full accessibility on various disability commissions and committees in Maryland.\n\nMy journey to tackle ableism, however, would not end there. After being diagnosed with a mental health condition, I began to unpack the realities of the stigma surrounding mental illness — and discovering how much progress needs to be made.In 2014, I was hospitalized and first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As I struggled to accept the diagnosis, I refused to follow up with psychiatric treatment or take my medication as directed, which led to a much more serious bipolar episode in 2019 that almost cost me my life. After surviving a suicide attempt, I listened to my doctors, took my medication and, more importantly, accepted my diagnosis. Today, I take my medication as directed and continue to see my psychiatrist on a regular basis.\n\nWhen I was first hospitalized in 2014, however, I was too ashamed to tell anyone that I had a mental health issue. I was afraid to talk about it because I, like so many others, held deeply internalized negative attitudes about mental illness and seeking help. This stigma was something that all of my fellow patients wrestled with during their hospitalizations: They simply didn’t know how to tell other people about their mental illness.\n\nDuring group therapy we were told we shouldn’t be afraid or ashamed to share our diagnosis with others. But that wisdom was hard to accept. Frankly, my initial reaction was, “It’s one thing to tell people that I was hospitalized due to my cerebral palsy. It’s a whole other thing to say I am bipolar, and I just got out of the hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit (what many people incorrectly label the psych ward).”\n\nBefore being hospitalized for mental health treatment, I had only heard people with mental health issues described as “crazy,” so I was afraid to open up about my own diagnosis.Since my time in treatment, I have noticed that we seem to have no trouble talking endlessly about our physical health when we get together with family and friends: “I just went to see a new orthopedist.”  “I just completed a new round of physical therapy.” etc. Our health comes up naturally in both serious conversations and small talk. But we don’t open up about our mental health in a similar, casual way.\n\nYou rarely hear someone mentioning that they were just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or that they’re running late to a therapy appointment. This needs to change; if we continue to hide the reality of our mental health, we perpetuate a cycle of stigma and shame. If you don’t speak up, someone else will continue to suffer in silence.\n\nTo do my part in dismantling a culture of stigma and silence, I will confidently tell others that I have bipolar disorder or mention that I have an appointment with my psychiatrist. By normalizing my experience, I hope to play a part in removing the stigma and fear surrounding mental health. My story is evidence of how someone can live and thrive with both a physical disability and a mental health issue. Now, I’m comfortable saying, “I have cerebral palsy, I have bipolar disorder, and I’m not alone. Many of us have physical disabilities and mental health issues.”\n\nI not only pay attention when people use the wrong words to describe people with physical disabilities (“crippled,” for example), but I also notice when people use negative words like “crazy” to describe those of us with mental health issues. I don’t hesitate to let people know that, “I have a disability. I’m not crippled.” And I say, “I am not crazy. I have a mental health condition.”\n\nI was fortunate to get the help I needed, and I hope anyone else struggling will do the same. If I can encourage one person to get help in an emergency by reaching out to a family member, friend, general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist, my story will have made a difference.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing emotional distress or thoughts of suicide, help is available. Call the NAMI HelpLine at 1-800-950-6264, Monday-Friday, 10 a.m. to 10 p.m., ET. Or in a crisis text “NAMI” to 741741 for 24/7, confidential, free crisis counseling.

      "body": "In a segment of his show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” famed comedian, television host and political commentator Bill Maher joked that then-president Donald Trump received his news from “a passing mental patient.” The implication was, given Maher’s criticisms of Trump’s competence, that such patients lack any awareness of their surroundings or the intelligence to determine fact from fiction. Of course, Maher’s joke got the laughs he was looking for. But the fact that a public figure can entertain an audience by resorting to negative stereotypes of people with mental illness is proof that stigma is alive and well in society — and it does not need to lurk in the shadows.Popular comedy sets, TV shows and social media discourse alike are rife with jokes about “looney bins,” “straitjackets” and “crazy people” hearing voices. Moreover, these harmful depictions often go unchallenged, allowing stigma to proliferate.It seems that this pervasive stigma lies in the time-worn misconception that mental health conditions are a personal and moral failing — rather than illnesses requiring treatment, much like any other health issue. As a result, far too many people see those with mental health conditions as “damaged” people who are responsible for their own afflictions and simply unable to make better choices.This misguided judgment, in turn, leads to the isolation and marginalization of people with mental illness. Some internalize this stigma, and their shame prevents them from seeking help. Others may seek help but feel obligated to hide their experience for fear of social and professional repercussions. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable and perpetuate a cycle of judgment, shame and pain.Unfortunately, a secondary perpetrator of stigmatization can be the medical profession itself. For far too long, practitioners have approached physical health and mental health separately. Physical health, it seems, is treated as “real medicine,” while mental health is regarded as a separate, and often lesser, discipline. This separation also impacts the language we use. When someone receives inpatient treatment for a physical illness, we simply say that someone was “hospitalized.” When referring to inpatient treatment for mental health conditions, we often use much more offensive language about the nature of treatment, such as “went to the madhouse.”To begin changing the cultural taboo, we need to talk more about the reality of mental health. Understanding the basic science is a good place to start: The brain is an organ, and, like other organs, illness surfaces when it malfunctions. Disruptions in mood, appetite and sleep, for example, are indicators of a chemical imbalance in the brain. A more accurate representation of mental illness (in media and elsewhere) would understand that mental health is health — and it has physical origins. Deepening this understanding will allow us to move away from the misconception that mental health conditions are a choice.Of course, perfectly representing mental illness — in media and beyond — is challenging. Living with mental illness, much like having a physical ailment, does not translate to one universal experience; accordingly, there is no singular, accurate characterization of a person with a mental illness. However, we must demand a variety of representations rather than settle for the tired, harmful tropes of a “mental patient” with a loose grasp on reality.In actuality, mental illness can affect anyone, anywhere and at any time. It doesn’t matter what a person’s moral fortitude or station in life is. Additionally, mental illness will present differently in different people. It can look like a person detached from reality. It can also look like creative genius (Virginia Woolfe, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Walt Whitman, to name a few).It is time to extinguish the embers of mental health stigma. This process cannot happen overnight, as negative conceptions are deeply woven into our socialization. Stigmatizing language goes unchallenged, promoting a silent acceptance of the status quo. As a result, harmful language and careless jokes litter our social media feeds and flood our screens. But these jokes hurt real people and ignore their humanity. Mental illness has many faces, and it could be your sibling, parent, friend or partner — and their worth must not be measured by what diagnosis they have, but who they are.This piece was written by an anonymous contributor with the help of NAMI Staff.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I was walking through the self-help section of a bookstore. A title caught my eye: “Disarming the Narcissist: Surviving and Thriving with the Self-Absorbed.” For several years, I have had a clinical interest in working with patients with narcissistic personalities, and so I felt discouraged by the tone of this title.I felt worse upon realizing it was one of many books within this theme. Shoppers could have also purchased “Becoming the Narcissist’s Nightmare: How to Devalue and Discard the Narcissist While Supplying Yourself” or even “How to Kill a Narcissist: Debunking the Myth of Narcissism and Recovering from Narcissistic Abuse.”I wondered: How have we reached the point where former loved ones are meant to be discarded, devalued and disarmed? If you are reading this blog, you may know someone with narcissistic traits or even identify with some of these qualities — and you may benefit from a more nuanced discussion.Clinically, narcissistic personality disorder is viewed as a disorder of self that results in character traits of self-emphasis, grandiose ideations and behaviors that impair relationships — ranging from demands for adoration to entitlement and exploitative behaviors.There can be no doubt: Forging a co-existence with someone with these qualities is complex, and I would never encourage someone to persist in a relationship with a partner who is unwilling to self-reflect, self-challenge and seek the help they need.But what underlies this condition?Psychologists and therapists who work with this population know people with narcissistic traits hold esteem split at both high and low extremes, not just high esteem as is the common trope. Plainly, people with a narcissistic condition suffer from low self-esteem for which they often compensate with a vulnerable and easily shattered grandiosity. If you have ever seen someone ricochet from self-admiration to self-deprecation in an instant, you may have a clear mental image of this internal process.In other words, a narcissistic personality is a form of defense against emotional pain and inner turbulence.When we simply examine symptoms of narcissism on their own, we lose sight of systems that create such personalities and how, at the root, there is often trauma. Complex trauma, violent or sexual traumatic experiences, and the accumulation of stress secondary to identity-based trauma can contribute to elevated narcissism. In clinical settings, the individual with narcissism often presents with a history of caregiver neglect, attachment dysfunction, persistent invalidation and traumatic disruptions to development that increase the likelihood for a personality that neither serves the individual nor others well.I wonder, if one takes a deep breath and reflects, if reframing narcissism as a disorder of trauma lessens the intensity of our reaction to the word?The brain craves simplicity. This is why we think in terms of binaries (e.g., this is good/this is bad; this is safe/this is dangerous). Making a quick decision moves us forward and feels comfortable. Tolerating ambiguity and complexity, such as how all people hold both positive and negative qualities, can be mentally taxing. And so, even with our limited bandwidth, I challenge us to consider the costs of simplifying a complicated issue. Reducing our loved ones into a binary may ease navigation of conflict in the short-term — yet it comes at the expense of long-term relational insight. Through contextualizing traits in others, we remember our common humanity.Healing begins there.When we hold ourselves and others as whole, complex beings, we are empowered to make sense of our experiences and narratives. This perspective helps to make our boundaries stronger, relationships balanced and our former relationships appreciated in their full context.A core complaint of having a relationship with someone with narcissism is the experience of feeling objectified and devalued. As a result, the hurt person may unconsciously devalue the individual with narcissism — or devalue people with narcissism generally. Unchecked and unaware, this devaluation of people with narcissistic personalities carries substantial risk.Devaluation and stigma complicate clinicians’ ability to diagnose the condition (for desire to protect their patients from hardship) and reduces the likelihood that people with these personalities will seek needed care. Would you trust a practitioner to help when they tell someone else to discard you?I understand and respect the intention of resources created to support someone in — or recovering from — an abusive relationship. These relationships are unacceptable and untenable. However, finding appropriate care can be nearly impossible when stigma runs so high or paints your personality as singular in presentation (i.e., portraying all people with narcissism as “toxic”).To heal, we must see ourselves and others as whole. People with narcissistic personalities are among our partners, family and friends, and they deserve quality care and safe access to treatment and self-help supports.Dr. Jackson Newsome is a licensed clinical psychologist and the founder of his private practice: Forge Psychology Chicago.

      "body": "One night in college, my friend (I’ll call Alex) told me about a traumatic moment in their life. At some point during the story, they began gliding over their R’s. New York, I thought, but how had I never noticed they had an accent before? A few minutes later, they referred to themselves in the third person.Before I realized what was happening, Alex blinked and cracked their neck. And everything was normal again; no accent, not even a memory of the conversation. “Switching,” I would eventually learn to call it. This interaction, I later realized, was my first experience with a person who has dissociative identity disorder (DID). In the moment, I’d nearly missed it.Over the course of our friendship, I met more of Alex’s alters, distinct personalities with unique names, genders, ages, interests and worldviews. One spoke languages that Alex did not. Some remembered otherwise lost fragments of childhood. Together, they made up a collective “system” — a group of personalities helping to manage Alex’s trauma. If Alex felt threatened, a more assertive alter might step in. If they felt especially safe, or silly, a childlike one might emerge. In the case of flashbacks, it wasn’t uncommon for an alter to come out just to give Alex a break. Sometimes the switching process was noticeable, but often it was not.I wanted to be sensitive to Alex’s experience, but I was full of questions. Who exactly was my friend? The entire system, or only the person I’d met first (often referred to as the host)? Did the alters count, too? Were they separate, different people? If one of them did something Alex didn’t remember, who was responsible?I wasn’t able to resolve these questions in a satisfying way. So, I did what I’ve always done with questions: I looked for stories to help me understand. Unfortunately, the stories I found were anything but helpful.Perhaps the following story sounds familiar: A mild-mannered protagonist pursues a criminal. Over time, the hunt turns desperate, dangerous. Our protagonist finds himself disoriented and confused. Finally, at a breaking point, he falls to his knees and realizes: Our hero is the very killer he’s been looking for.As I went looking for films about DID, this was basically what I found: Stories of evil alter egos and traumatized murderers, like “Secret Window,” “Primal Fear” and “Mr. Brooks,” to name a few. DID was almost always confined to that single, murderous reveal — a twisty iteration of Jekyll and Hyde. Even the few non-murderous representations — “The Three Faces of Eve” and “Sybil,” for example — were highly sensationalized, with dozens of alters ripping the protagonist’s life apart.None of these films came even close to representing my friend’s experience. Alex was a high-achieving college student who also maintained a side job. I regularly went to them for advice. They just also happened to have DID.I caught wind that a major studio was set to release a big-budget DID story in 2016. Judging by what had come before, I didn’t have much reason to be hopeful, but I was. Maybe this one would be helpful, accurate, faithful. Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” is a disastrous representation. Kevin Crumb, played by James McAvoy is, just like the others, confined to the role of murderous antagonist. But the movie doesn’t stop there. In the final act, Crumb switches to his “Beast” alter personality — a superhuman cannibal who wants to rid the world of the non-traumatized.Almost immediately, the mental health community decried the film as inaccurate and harmful, just another portrayal that would implicitly claim traumatized people were a danger to society (despite virtually every statistic showing people with DID are more likely to be victims of crimes than perpetrators). Critics who had lived experience with DID wrote an open letter to M. Night Shyamalan, calling the film a “gross parody based on fear, ignorance and sensationalism, only much worse.” Despite this, “Split” went on to gross almost $280 million worldwide and even spawned a sequel.Watching these films made me wonder: Why are we so afraid of people who have survived trauma? Or, if we aren’t, why do so many of our stories suggest otherwise? Do we really believe that once a person has suffered, the only social recourse is for the rest of us to avoid them?When our only depictions of an already-stigmatized mental illness include sensationalized misinformation, it causes undeniable harm. Moreover, movies like “Split,” I’d argue, are not about DID and trauma at all; rather, they are about pondering what makes someone capable of evil. They fail to highlight that monsters are the abusers who cause trauma, not survivors of trauma who are left to cope. The big question for most survivors of trauma is not “Am I capable of evil?” It’s “How do I live when evil has already been done to me?”DID is a coping mechanism in the face of unrelenting trauma. Indeed, some alters took the brunt of the past abuse, thereby keeping the host capable of going about daily life, unaware of the full extent of their own trauma. Alex’s story is not an outlier. Millions of children experience neglect, trauma and abuse. But when it comes time to write the story, many creatives seem more comfortable portraying DID as demon possession — the stuff of horrifying twist-endings, rather than face the reality of what happens to far too many children.As I continued to grapple with my lingering questions about Alex and explored the complex reality of being close to someone as they confront trauma, I refused to accept the on-screen portrayals of my friend as a monster. So, I decided to tell a new story: My debut novel, “When Fire Splits the Sky,” which will be released in the fall. The story is told from the perspective of a couple, in which one partner has DID, as they confront a catastrophe and assess their crumbling relationship.I hoped this would address some of those lingering questions: How would a person already adapted to trauma respond to a widespread crisis? How would alters handle something like a long-term relationship? What if only some of them wanted the relationship? How would they respond to a betrayal of trust?This portrayal is by no means perfect, but I’ve done my best to honor the experience of my friend — and their alters, who read and provided feedback at multiple stages, giving their blessing to the final project before I sent it out into the world.My hope is to answer the question I have been asking myself since the start of this journey — what would it be like to center a story on DID in an authentic, non-sensationalized way?Tyler James Russell is the author of “To Drown a Man” (2020), a poetry collection, and a forthcoming novel “When Fire Splits the Sky” (November 2022) from Unsolicited Press.

      "body": "As mental health experts and people living with mental illness know all too well, the stigma surrounding mental illness can be highly destructive. Indeed, negative and discriminatory attitudes that are commonly held about people living with mental illness can adversely impact nearly every aspect of their lives.Notably, this cultural taboo discourages many people from seeking help. Leaving symptoms untreated often makes them worse — ultimately powering a vicious cycle of stigma and poor mental health. Thus, the impact of stigma can be as severe as the consequences of the illness itself. I know. I live with serious mental illness (SMI) and the forces of stigma.Addressing stigma is not easy, as these tightly held misconceptions of mental illness are pervasive and systemic. We need much more than time-limited, attention-grabbing sound bite campaigns. We need campaigns of substance. Anti-stigma interventions must seek to do what’s best for people living with mental illness, first and foremost. We need to prioritize approaches that create opportunities for maximum impact and positive outcomes.Here are several methods and best practices to consider when combatting stigma surrounding mental illness.Research suggests that there are three primary methods that are effective in addressing stigma:Based on my own lived experience, here are a few important groups to keep in mind when reducing stigma. Note that stigma interventions should be tailored to the individuals, populations and specific circumstances being targeted.People with Mental Illness\nSelf-stigma is pervasive and a major barrier toward recovery. To best target those dealing with self-stigma, interventions should raise awareness about the possibility of recovery. This involves sharing stories of success and encouraging people to pursue recovery by including seeking, accepting, engaging and adhering to treatment and participating in life activities. It is also important for targeted campaigns to be relatable.Anti-stigma messages targeted to people with mental illness can include:Clinicians\nUltimately, I found that stigma from health care providers can be the most harmful. Indeed, I could have reached recovery sooner if I had more constructive relationship with my mental health professionals. Their stigmatizing language and behavior — like the time my former psychiatrist told me that my condition would only get worse — were impediments to healing. As a result, I developed a “why bother?” attitude, as many patients do. A prognosis should be realistic, but it should also be hopeful, no matter how challenging a situation is. For me, and many other patients, coping with the long-term impacts of practitioners’ missteps was critical in reaching recovery.Anti-stigma messages aimed at clinicians can include:Loved Ones and Friends\nStigma coming from loved ones can be the most hurtful, even if it’s unintentional. When our loved ones appear to be ashamed and embarrassed of us, it can be extremely hurtful. For example, my parents and spouse worried about what people might think of them personally and professionally if they learned of my illness. I lost my best “friend” of over 20 years and many more when I got sick, because they did not want to “associate” themselves with someone with a mental illness.Anti-stigma messages targeted to loved ones can include:All interventions should be inspired and informed by those of us with mental illness. Accordingly, anti-stigma campaigns should be thoughtfully designed, implemented and executed with our direct involvement. They should always be creative and engaging to maximize reach and adoption — and, critically, they should meet people “where they’re at.” This means that messages should be accessible, while remaining well-informed by reliable evidence-based sources of information and involving individuals with subject matter expertise (such as medical, academic, legal and lived experience).It’s also important to note that a wide variety of types of interventions can be effective, if well executed. For example, short-term interventions, like NAMI Walks, can be very effective at bringing large groups of people together and create heightened awareness of issues. Meanwhile, long-term interventions, like lobbying government bodies, can lead to meaningful impacts, such as criminal justice reform and legislative change.These interventions must recognize the realities and possibilities of our lives and, most importantly, they should acknowledge that such possibilities include recovery and full life. A recovery-centric, anti-stigma campaign may be the solution to dismantling stigma while inspiring hope. Ultimately, successful initiatives will always reflect the philosophy of “nothing about us without us.”Helpful resource: Patrick Corrigan, The Stigma Effect: Unintended Consequences of Mental Health Campaigns.A word on NAMI: Since its founding in 1979, NAMI has led many highly successful national and local anti-stigma interventions that have bettered the lives of countless people affected by mental illness.

      "body": "The television screen goes dark, then flashes red. There’s a scream. Broken glass. Laughter. Then, the image returns. A nurse prepares a syringe. A man in a straitjacket talks to himself, responding to apparent voices in his head. The background music crescendos dramatically. The man talks faster and begins twitching. The nurse walks faster. Her white heels click on the shining floor. A team of Hollywood creatives has achieved their goal by inspiring fear in me — and likely, many other viewers — thanks to their use of the antiquated trope of a scary and abusive psychiatric ward.With so many movies to choose from, psychiatric hospital horror is its own genre of film. Perhaps you’ve been terrified by scenes from classic films like “Clockwork Orange” or “Asylum,” 2000s movies like “Shutter Island” or “Insanitarium,”and even newer films like “Unsane,” or “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum.” These films (some of which have received critical acclaim) have certainly elevated the thriller/horror genre. But they go beyond telling a gripping story; they perpetuate negative stereotypes about treatment centers and the patients who seek care there. Because most people don’t encounter real psychiatric units, these on-screen depictions may be the only representation of psychiatric treatment audiences will ever see.Unsurprisingly, then, our first associations with inpatient psychiatric treatment are danger, unlivable conditions, unpredictability and even abuse. As a result, those needing inpatient treatment are hesitant (and often quite resistant) to entering a facility. Loved ones are often scared to visit. And, ultimately, people who have taken the steps to get help and recover rarely admit to having spent time in an inpatient facility. Spending time in a psych ward is taboo, and the decision to get help is understood as a dirty secret rather than a sometimes-necessary step toward recovery.To dismantle the stigma surrounding hospitalization and psychiatric treatment, it’s important to share the truth about the experience. If we can be transparent about how inpatient treatment works — and what a potential stay might look like — we can start to challenge the terrorizing depictions on our screens.As many movie buffs have asked, “so, what?” Horror movies are made for the purpose of entertainment — just a thrilling escape from reality that people enjoy. Everyone knows that the tortured and possessed patients are made-up characters in a fictionalized world. However, the lived experience of mental illness and seeking treatment is not so simple. While audiences can acknowledge that these cinematic worlds aren’t real, they still fail to separate the negative associations from people with mental illness.Those experiencing mental health crises still hear stigmatizing language and painful labels: “crazy,” “psycho,” “nuts,” “insane” — even “possessed.” Naturally, no one wants to be called these names or have this judgment cast upon them.So, those who need help may avoid it. They don’t go to treatment. They don’t get the help they need, and they get worse. Often, this culminates in patients being forced into hospitalization. Then, after doing the work to find recovery, they will keep their experience a secret. Seeking treatment and finding recovery becomes a skeleton in the closet. But ultimately, a support system is vital to any type of healing.To have a support system, you have to say you need support. Many patients close off further; they shrink their support systems rather than growing and strengthening them — all because of public perception, a perception propagated by the antiquated trope of the “scary” mental health ward.That’s why it matters. Public perception matters. Public perception influences people’s opinions of who they are and what they “should” do. Accurate representations of psychiatric units in movies and television could be a positive influence for people to get the help they need and deserve.Ginger Robertson is a registered nurse and mental health blogger.

      "body": "In 2011, when I was diagnosed with major depressive order and generalized anxiety disorder during my first semester of college, I wasn’t exactly surprised. Mostly, I was relieved to have an explanation. The diagnoses felt like a validation of the sleepless nights, unexplainable chest pains, spiraling thoughts, crushing despair and constant exhaustion. There was a name for — and a reason why — someone with an objectively good life couldn’t manage to get out of bed and face reality every day.But as I scanned the insurance paperwork (which was marked with specific numbers corresponding to diagnoses) and reviewed the slip of paper prescribing medication, I felt a lump in my throat. I wasn’t sure how to share this information with those closest to me. Would they see me differently? Would they say I was unstable? Or “crazy”?Friends and family had expressed concerns about my behavior in the past — the hyperventilating, the constant fear of the future, the days spent in bed — but having an actual name for this behavior felt so official. So clinical. How would I convince my friends, family, potential partners, teachers or future bosses that I was trustworthy? Or capable? Or normal?To manage my anxiety and depression, I began attending therapy sessions regularly and taking daily medication. These changes to my routine were lifesaving; my problems didn’t go away, but they suddenly felt manageable. I even developed specific coping mechanisms to address my panic attacks and depressive spirals. Still, despite the obvious improvement in my day-to-day life, I was embarrassed about the new label I’d been saddled with. My face flushed when my roommates caught me taking pills in the morning, and I found myself scanning the street outside my therapist’s office, terrified of seeing a familiar face.To ease my own discomfort (and what I assumed to be the discomfort of others) I mocked myself mercilessly. By addressing the elephant in the room, I reasoned, I was protecting myself. Maybe a harsh word or an unsolicited opinion about my mental health would hurt less if I said it first. So, I made sure to call my daily medication “my crazy pills.” I consistently referred to myself as “emotionally unstable,” “chemically imbalanced” and, in the opening line of a dating app profile, “a hot mess of DSM terms.”Throwing around careless language, I quickly realized, did not make me feel better. My anxiety escalated as I tried to read people’s facial expressions and over-analyzed their reactions when I mentioned my mental health. The more I tried to eliminate the awkwardness, the more negative attention I drew to myself. And I certainly wasn’t putting anyone else at ease. Friends and strangers alike usually stared at the floor, unsure of how to respond, when I made a joke about my mental illness.Moreover, my toxic approach to addressing my own situation emboldened those who were not as well-intentioned to use similarly offensive terms. I was taken aback when a classmate referred to his partner as “certifiably insane” and winced when another joked about how her mother needed to be “committed to a psych ward” for her constant text messaging. But how could I expect them to speak carefully or respectfully when I consistently referred to myself as “a lunatic”?After several months of making jokes at my own expense (and, of course, unpacking this behavior in therapy), I realized that the stigma and judgment I feared was not coming from those around me — it was coming from me. My offensive quips to cut the tension only perpetuated negative stereotypes about mental illness. They also made otherwise normal conversations awkward and tense. So, I made a concerted effort to change my approach.I began talking openly about therapy with my friends, even sharing valuable insights my therapist had given me when it was appropriate. Eventually, I had offered so much advice that I became a resource to friends who needed strategies for managing stress. “Thank God for your therapist,” one friend joked. “She makes all of our lives better.”I also began referencing therapy in a casual way, much like how my friends talked about their various medical appointments. When comparing schedules to organize a group outing, we planned around Katy’s wrist MRI and my therapy appointment. Over time, my mental illness became a medical issue as mundane as any other.Years later, as the national conversation about mental health has continued to evolve, many of those friends have begun therapy themselves. And talking about our mental health now feels as comfortable as talking about what TV shows we’re watching. It’s one small part of who we are — and it carries no connotations of “craziness” or incompetence, like I once feared.While I am extraordinarily lucky to have a community that understands the reality of mental illness, that doesn’t mean that everyone I encounter has risen above the pervasive stigma. Sometimes, making progress requires having tough conversations.Perhaps the hardest part of combatting stigma is having difficult conversations with the people you see regularly. However, I’ve found that being gentle and honest is an effective way to start. I’m open about my mental health conditions and I’m happy to answer questions that people have. If I hear someone using the careless language I once used, I take the opportunity to share my lived experience.Change doesn’t happen overnight.

      "body": "As a Black woman living with mental illness, I’ve been told plenty of times by other Black people that I should not talk about my experience managing my mental health condition. That sentiment is always frustrating and discouraging to hear.The pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness in the Black community often makes me feel like my life is embarrassing and that I must hide a major part of myself. Sometimes, this shame can be too much to bear. But it also led me to wonder: How widespread is mental illness itself in the Black community? I figured that understanding the statistics would make it easier to erase the stigma.I did some research, and as it turns out, I am certainly not the only Black person experiencing mental illness. Among the nearly 5 million Black people living with a mental illness, nearly a quarter reported having a serious condition, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, among many others.Despite that sizeable number, only 1 out of every 3 seek suitable treatment, which could include meeting with a mental health professional, such as a social worker, therapist or psychiatrist. While there are many factors contributing to the discrepancy between prevalence and people seeking adequate treatment — ranging from the prevalence of misdiagnosis to the lack of access to adequate medical care — stigma in the Black community still remains an insidious culprit.The Black community, and truly all communities, can engage in four activities to help get rid of stigma around mental illness.Stigma stems from a lack of knowledge, and the best way to fight a gap in information is by educating others in our community. There are numerous public resources on the different types of mental illnesses. Personally, I turned to resources on websites for the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, National Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health America.These were helpful places to start because they provided me with basic information and helped me recognize the negative preconceived notions I had about mental illness. They also directed me to places where I could learn even more. I also sought advice on what to read from the mental health professionals in my life, which I suggest everyone do as well. I read so many books and articles that, eventually, I had the language I needed to speak about my mental illness.I have noticed that, in our community, we often equate strength with being silent and stoic — and that speaking up and asking for help is weakness. I believe the opposite is true. That’s why I have chosen to be open with my family and friends about living with a mental illness — and I emphasize the fact that I have won prestigious fellowships, scholarships and awards in spite of it all. I’ve also written about seeking help after experiencing a traumatic event.Living with a mental illness doesn’t define anyone, nor does it limit anyone’s abilities. Showcasing our best selves — with mental health issues and all — reveals to some that we are just as capable as anyone else when it comes to leading a successful life.As more Black people open up about living with a mental illness, the closer we will get to dismantling the stigma in our community. There is genuine comradery found in knowing that I am not the only Black person living with a mental illness. Celebrities like Taraji P. Henson, Jenifer Lewis and Janet Jackson, among many others, have opened up about their experiences with mental illnesses ranging from depression to bipolar disorder. Henson even founded The Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation in 2018 in memory of her late father. The more we recognize that mental illness can affect anyone, from your next-door neighbor to your personal hero, the more real and less frightening mental illness becomes to our community.Believing people when they say they have a mental illness is vital to eradicating stigma. When someone has a mental health crisis or expresses emotional distress, telling them to simply “pray it away” or to “fix your attitude” isn’t helpful. Failing to consider that people do, in fact, live with mental illness — and being dismissive in our advice — dissuades people from coming forward with how they are truly feeling. This sometimes causes people to not seek appropriate medical help.These suggestions are just first steps when it comes to overcoming mental health stigma in the Black community. We must do better and be better when it comes to supporting other Black people living with mental illnesses, myself included. I hope my thoughts push discussions further and foster a more productive and positive dialogue. While not everyone in the Black community has a diagnosis, it’s important to keep in mind that mental illness can affect anyone, including our community.Brakeyshia R.

      "body": "As I reflect on my journey with mental health, both personally and professionally, I am reminded how stigma pervades casual conversation and language — and just how damaging this stigma can be. For as long as I can remember, I have heard people use mental health diagnoses to describe everyday scenarios, like temperature changes or when an individual expresses organic emotions that do not need to be defined or clinically labeled. These casual mentions of “bipolar weather” or “crazy individuals” are not just momentarily offensive; they have wide-reaching consequences that deeply impact the lived experience of people with mental illness.When I entered the mental health profession, I brought along my own history of trauma, which contributed to bouts of debilitating anxiety and depression. After leaving the Air Force and seeking treatment, I encountered some great (as well as a few not-so-great) providers. I learned what it felt like to be heard and validated; unfortunately, I also learned what it felt like to be labeled and reduced to a diagnosis.My personal experiences, both the good and the bad, led to a deeper level of empathy and understanding for the individuals I would encounter later in my career as a therapist. My own experience in the mental health care system fueled my desire to hold space and advocate for people with mental illness, who are active members of society deserving of equal treatment and a life without labels.After several years of working in the mental health field as a behavioral health technician, case manager and team lead, I returned to school to become a therapist. I will never forget the passion I felt when I wrote my letter of intent to submit with my application. I told my personal story and explained how this ignited my desire to become a therapist.Now, years later — after continuing to see the impact of stigma and labeling from “the other side” — I hope to discuss stigma from the eyes of a clinician.Navigating a world riddled with labels, judgment and shaming can be exhausting and disheartening for anyone. Naturally, feeling like our many qualities, talents and complexities have been reduced to a single word or label is hurtful. For people with mental illness, this compounds an already-challenging circumstance: Managing and seeking treatment for a mental health condition.As I have observed in my clients, many people feel reduced to the label of their diagnosis and the careless language others have used to describe them. This, in turn, often leads to:Oftentimes, I have found myself working with individuals who have struggled with thoughts of being seen as “broken” and “worthless” due to the impact that stigmatizing language has had on the way they see themselves.Ultimately, labeling individuals — whether out of frustration or a general lack of understanding — contributes to an unhealthy culture of stigmatizing mental illness. As a result, people with mental health conditions are unduly burdened by others’ perceptions.Unfortunately, stigma is not limited to clients’ personal lives; it often invades clinical settings.To this day, I cringe when I hear anyone in the mental health field use stigmatizing language, like the word “crazy,” or refer to clients by the name of their diagnosis rather than describing them as the human they are at the core. The use of careless language demonstrates a gap in appropriate education, and it underscores the importance of clinicians approaching their work with a trauma-informed perspective.Practitioners’ use of stigmatizing language does not simply impact their clients — it can also wreak havoc in the workplace and drive the fear of speaking up. For example, careless conversations amongst colleagues in a medical setting could impact a provider’s willingness to seek help for themselves out of fear of being labeled or judged in their place of work. Instead of disclosing the need for help with managing difficult emotions or previously diagnosed mental illnesses, providers may attempt to navigate these difficulties themselves — hoping to avoid being labeled as “too incompetent ”or “not stable enough” to do their jobs.While clinicians have a role to play in eliminating stigma in mental health settings, there are steps that all people can take to change our cultural attitudes toward mental illness. We can change the lived experience of people with mental illness by addressing hurtful labels, calling out reductive language and changing the conversation about mental illness in our own lives.A few ways of fighting the stigma include but are not limited to:Ultimately, the conversation surrounding mental illness does not need to be riddled with labels and stigma. It can be a hopeful and productive dialogue that highlights the bravery, diligence and resilience of people with mental health conditions.Joshualin Dean is a therapist in Tampa, Fla.

      "body": "This year marks a decade since I first sought treatment for my mental health. During my sophomore year of college, following nearly five years of chronic and debilitating migraines, I was referred to a school therapist. Shortly after visiting the school psychiatrist and therapist, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Later, in graduate school, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) following a sexual assault.Ten years after that initial therapy session, I have made strides in my recovery — and I continue to pursue therapy. Over the last decade, I have learned a lot about myself and about mental health. The following are my main takeaways from treatment that I hope to share with others who may be struggling.For much of my life, I spent every moment working or thinking about working. My career consumed my life. However, my time in therapy has given me perspective and specific relaxation techniques to calm my anxieties. Some of these techniques include imagining I am brushing my stressors off, emotional freedom technique (EFT) tapping and freewriting about anxiety in my journal. As a result, my anxiety, which I have named Mr. Peanut and talk to, visits far less frequently.On my most recent vacation to celebrate completing the seventh semester of my doctoral program, for instance, my anxiety stayed at home, and I truly enjoyed my vacation. This was largely due to my new coping skills and progress in therapy; I proactively wrote out a task list of my pending projects before the vacation and set up out-of-office notifications so I could remain anxiety-free throughout the trip. Previously, I would have spent the trip stressing about my self-imposed, never-ending to-do lists and checking my work email. Instead, I enjoyed food, TV shows and shopping — without the normal intrusion of worry and anxiety.Ten years into therapy to address my anxiety, I only experience migraines once monthly, at the most. Yet, there are still hours or days when my panic attacks, disassociation or OCD get the best of me. During these times, I find myself ruminating about my tasks lists and client projects, catastrophizing or feeling like I am completely out of my body. However, over the years, I have come to understand that progress is not always linear, and my recovery is a lifelong journey.With this perspective, I finally feel equipped to deal with any mental health challenges that come my way. Now, I possess the confidence and faith that any mental health struggles I face are temporary and will pass — just as they always have.I used to be afraid to talk openly about mental health and to share my story, largely due to the stigma surrounding mental illness (and the resulting discrimination). However, with practice, and with the encouragement of those around me, I am now able to proudly share my mental health journey with friends and family, coaching clients, with large audiences and even with global publications.While I am proud to be reducing the stigma associated with mental health, I also found that sharing my story is critical to my recovery. Sharing my story of recovery soothes Mr. Peanut and reminds me that I am not alone.In fact, I was so impacted by the power of sharing my mental health story that I decided to write my doctoral dissertation on the influence of mental health self-stigma and mental health storytelling on college students.If you are struggling with your mental health, please know that help is available, recovery is possible and sharing your story can make a positive difference in the lives of those living with mental health conditions.Kyle Elliott, MPA, CHES, is the founder and career coach behind CaffeinatedKyle.com.

      "body": "It happens to me a lot when I talk about my depression. Someone will suggest that I “be grateful” for the wonderful life I have. By acknowledging the many positives in my life and by expressing gratitude, they reason, I won’t be “so depressed.”I fully acknowledge that I have an amazing life, and I’ve always had what I needed. But having my basic needs met — and even having wonderful things and people around me — does not “solve” my major depressive disorder, anxiety and personality disorder. Frankly, when dealing with the challenges of mental illness, it can be difficult to feel and express gratitude.This increasingly common notion that a good mindset overpowers a mental health condition is a biproduct of an increasingly toxic positivity movement. “Good vibes only” is a catchy phrase, but it fails to consider the painful and even dangerous reality of depressive episodes. This type of “positivity only” thinking can aid in ignoring your problems and hiding uncomfortable emotions.Managing multiple mental health conditions while trying to live a full life can be an emotional, physical and logistical challenge. I fight hard every day to get out of bed, take care of my kids, manage the household, write for a newspaper, run my blog and volunteer for NAMI Greater Corpus Christi. Some days are more of a battle than others, and I can never simply “forget” about my depression — or how it affects my life and my family’s lives.Despite these challenges, I do count my blessings every single day. But I realize that having a positive attitude, while helpful, is not a cure. No matter how positively I think, I will continue to experience a chemical imbalance and symptoms that are not cured with willpower. Optimism and hope are important — but being realistic about my challenges and limitations is important, too.Moreover, not feeling gratitude when you’ve been instructed to “be positive” can lead to feelings of guilt and shame, ultimately making a depressive episode even worse. When someone is struggling with a severe depressive episode, they should be focused on their self-care and survival — not feelings of shame and inadequacy.New evidence suggests that the positivity mindset may not be as effective as we once thought. In 2020, Ohio State University released an analysis of 27 studies on gratitude in which they examined whether the practice actually reduced symptoms of depression. Ultimately, they found that impact of gratitude interventions on depression is more limited than past research suggested.Their conclusion resonated with me. When you’re in the throes of mental illness, like a depressive episode, it changes you — you lose interest in your hobbies, you isolate from family and friends, you can’t always practice good hygiene. Often, you’re so sad that you think you might break into a million pieces and attending to any responsibilities, like going to school or work, feels unsustainable. I understand why people aren’t always grateful. Perhaps the supposed “power of gratitude” doesn’t serve them at the time, and that’s ok.If you’re struggling with your mental health, don’t allow well-intentioned but uneducated comments to convince you that you’re ungrateful — and, even if you’re not feeling grateful, do not allow the opinion of others to influence your view of yourself. Millions of people in the U.S. live with major depression (and other mental health conditions), yet mental illness is still shrouded in stigma and misinformation. What we need is a cultural shift from toxic positivity to education and compassion. Shaming those who are struggling breeds more negative emotions — and we don’t need to compound our struggles.You can be both depressed and grateful — and don’t let anyone convince you otherwise — but you’re entitled to days where you don’t feel grateful at all.Sometimes, you will have days where counting your blessings feels impossible. This does not make you a bad person; it means you’re busy fighting to live your life. Not everyone sees this battle you wage in your body and mind. But I see you. There is a community that sees you. Keep fighting. Keep counting your blessings if it helps — and don’t count them if it doesn’t. The only thing you need to do is take care of you to the best of your ability, whatever that may be.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "Over the last couple of years, a moral panic has arisen over how to treat children and adolescents with gender dysphoria. Many anti-trans activists have questioned, and even sought to ban medical transitioning for those under 18, reducing the issue to an intellectual debate — as if, with enough talk therapy, trans identities can be eliminated.The reality is that this kind of discrimination has never been confined to the political sphere; the mental health profession and trans people haven’t really had a rosy relationship, and acceptance of trans identities within the profession is fairly recent. My own attempts at getting help for gender dysphoria tell a story of how difficult it was — and in some places, still is — to even talk with a therapist about gender identity issues.I was 16 years old the first time I tried to tell a therapist about my gender dysphoria. It was 1998, and I had originally gone to my therapist to sort out a recurring obsessive fear of what happens in the afterlife. Ever since my grandmother passed away when I was 12, I had relentless, spiraling anxiety about what happens to your consciousness after you die.It got to the point where I would often wake up screaming from nightmares about my brain just blacking out for all of eternity. My parents tried everything. I spoke with my school guidance counselor about it, and I even consulted my Catholic priest, who told me, “If there’s no afterlife, then Catholics are the world’s greatest fools.” The quote will stay with me for the rest of my life.Eventually, my death-related anxiety problem escalated to where we all agreed I needed some professional help.After about a dozen or so appointments with a younger therapist in my small New England town, I eventually felt comfortable enough to begin talking about my gender stuff. I say “gender stuff” because, at that time, I didn’t really have words to describe what I was feeling: An intense longing to be a girl. It was something I had felt for years, but everything I ever read about it was so alienating.First, I hit up the family encyclopedia, and eventually online forums to try to figure out what was “wrong” with me. I found scary sounding words I stumbled upon, like “transvestite” or “transsexual,” alongside unfamiliar definitions that implied I was some sort of sexual deviant. I was horrified and decided never to tell anyone.Until I met that first rural Massachusetts therapist. “I sometimes feel comfortable wearing girl’s clothes,” I remember telling her. She tried to ask composed follow ups, but the initial twisted look that flashed across her face gave away her feelings. Eventually, she seemed to almost shoo away discussion of my gender stuff, instead of insisting that I immediately tell my parents how I felt, a step I didn’t feel ready for yet.After a few more appointments, my therapist mysteriously stopped scheduling appointments for me. I tentatively told my mom, and even showed her some of the clothes I had stashed away in the back of my closet. But a few weeks later, I freaked out about it and told her it was just a phase and to please forget about it. The afterlife panics returned every couple of years, to the frustration of my loved ones.The second time I told a therapist about my gender dysphoria was when I was an adult. I had a panic attack on the way to work which I mistook for a heart attack. Instead of driving to work, I went to the local ER, which sent me to a walk-in psychiatric clinic across the street after determining that I did not, in fact, have a heart attack.The pattern was familiar. A few weeks into regular appointments with a therapist there, I tried bringing up my gender stuff again. My therapist at the time was a lesbian, but I could tell my gender stuff was an uncomfortable topic for her. She always tried to steer the conversation away from it.I left the practice frustrated and even more determined to never leave the closet. The afterlife panics only grew in frequency and intensity after that. I would say that I was never suicidal — in fact, part of my phobia was an intense fear of blinking out of existence for eternity — but death was nevertheless frequently on my mind. It was not healthy.In the summer of 2015, I finally broke and attempted suicide. Only a seemingly random but well-timed phone call from my mom saved me from that fate. It was at that point that I knew that I had to get help with my gender stuff. I searched for a long time for a therapist I could actually talk to about my gender stuff, having already figured out that I was experiencing gender dysphoria.In the first minute of my first appointment, I blurted out that I was transgender. It was the first time I had ever used that word out loud to describe myself to another person. She smiled and said, “Okay, I can help you.” I almost collapsed from the relief.It would take another nine months or so before I could access Hormone Replacement Therapy and begin the process of coming out, which wrecked my marriage and totally upended my family’s life. But funnily enough, the death-related anxiety also disappeared at that point.I know now that the two were related, and part of my obsessive thought process was worrying that if I died, my male form would be attached to my soul for eternity. Transitioning fixed that anxiety for me. At first, I thought it may have grown from my Catholic upbringing, but I’ve since heard from a bunch of other trans people that this fear of being bound to the wrong body is common for closeted trans people.It’s easy to sit around and declare that children don’t know themselves, and that you have to lead children to where you want them to go, but that’s not really true. Trans kids will opt out and continue hiding once they catch a whiff of hostility from their parents or mental health professionals — as I did. Instead, we need to be listening to trans kids and allow them the space and respect to determine the path that will get them help.Katelyn Burns is a freelance journalist and columnist at MSNBC.

      "body": "When I’m arranging flowers, I first pick out the greenery, often branches with full leaves, like the pepper tree or the viburnum bush. Then I choose a flower that intrigues me, usually one that yields many colors, depending upon how and where I look at it. I allow the colors to guide my next movements. I follow my eye, and trust that something will emerge. I build something — a tiny garden. A finite space constructed by me, made of nothing but water and plants.I don’t think this process differs too much from therapy. It’s most often when I’m creating that I’m able to make space for new meaning to live by. It’s often when I’m following a feeling that I am able to tap into the undercurrent of where that feeling was born. I think what we’re doing when pursuing self-work — whether it be through therapy or another route — is making space for our inner wisdom to reveal itself to us.I moved to California for graduate school, to pursue a degree in Expressive Arts Therapy, and I left a life behind. The voice of fear — my inner critic — predicted the pervasive loneliness, the heartbreak, the invisibility I’d feel during that transition. But it didn’t predict the wonder or openness that occurred underneath and past those points of withdrawal, largely due to the healing and expressive work I was doing. Using art to heal the memories of people telling me I could not be an artist allowed me to better connect with my clients.During my first year in the graduate program, for a student-led presentation on the unit of drama therapy, I put on a one-woman play in which I portrayed myself and my mother. It was six minutes long — nothing fancy. I chose to reenact a time when my mother called me a failure, and a time when we laughed together, in the car, on the way to New York, when she pretended to be a puppet who organizes the pantry by eating all the food inside of it. I shared the time when she’d written to me that I am much of what she would like to be; someone she feels she is not. I overlaid these short scenes with narration — words about how far away I felt from her, and how close I felt to her, at once. Through this exercise, I was able to express the grief of that confusion — loving someone who loves, hurts, understands and doesn’t understand you.I performed this in front of my classmates and teacher, who, afterwards, made me pieces of artwork called “aesthetic responses.” In the expressive arts world, aesthetic responses are, as they sound, artistic acknowledgements of what’s been shared. But, unlike feedback, it’s a process of giving back what was given to you. A moment of vulnerability for a moment of vulnerability. A movement, a painting, a song, a word, a flower.When I performed that six-minute play — a brief, truthful snapshot of a relationship — I was met by witnesses who received me by giving something back to me. This reenactment of my past, and the reciprocal process of sharing with a class, was a healing moment. Healing, like trauma, is a rearrangement. Being witnessed, absorbed and celebrated facilitates the process of rearrangement, and sometimes when it begins, you’re left only with water in a vase, and it is scarily blank.After this first performance, which resulted in many others, I noticed myself change and rearrange. Sharing became easier. Showing myself became easier. In my work with clients, when I invite them into a role play, or a performance of any kind, I work with their resistance. Often when there is little resistance, and they perform a scene or a feeling, I notice movement within our relationship.Recently, a fellow therapist and I were talking, and he told me he’s been in therapy for five years. He explained the first year of therapy as “getting beyond agreeability and the niceties.” The subsequent years, however, provide the tension — the intimate and awkward spaces in which he can occupy anger and withdrawal toward his therapist, without his therapist getting angry or shutting down in return.His interpretation stuck with me as I began practicing with my own clients; consistently approaching a client with compassion creates a sense of security — a new attachment in which expression is not punished but celebrated. Most of my clients enter the therapeutic space calling themselves “bad artists.” However, this would change over time as they continued to make art and understand the feelings that reside within their work. They would even be excited to show me what they’ve created. The voices of old art teachers who demeaned their expression faded away, replaced by a new voice of celebration.I decided to join an expressive arts women’s group, held by a former teacher of mine — a Mexican woman who had studied alongside indigenous women healers in Mexico called curanderas. There were large pieces of paper tacked onto the walls of the studio room. She had laid out bottles of paint, brushes and trays. I’d paint with red, black and gold; tons of jagged black lines. When feelings of rage arrived, I’d slap huge swaths of red onto the paper.Painting frequently and repetitively alongside other people created a kind of energetic field I still can’t fully describe. The huge and tiny movements of my arm, the sound of brushes touching paper around me, the feeling of being immersed in expression — it began to move something inside. I’d return the next week with a layer peeled back, and the next week, another, until I began to realize how deep my grief was. When I think about grief, I imagine many pools in the ground, and when I jump into any one of them, there lies a larger body of water underneath. I often tell my clients that we must jump into these pools in order to see how deep the water goes.Expressive Arts therapy, to me, is not simply about making art. It is about healing past traumas, quieting the voice of the inner critic and making space for expression and creation. But beyond that, it is about the process of following. It de-pathologizes the therapeutic process, uses metaphor to create safety and distance, and does not have rules. As someone who has never enjoyed following rules, it is essential to me that my work with clients does not get stuck within a model based upon what I “should” do. “Should-ing” is not involved in this process; movement is.Abby Taskier is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist at Axis Mundi Center for Mental Health in Oakland, Calif.

      "body": "During P.E. in my sophomore year of high school, the coach had the class stand up in a circle. “Take everything off your wrists,” she commanded. A few teens had bandanas and wide bracelets on; they took them off. “Now, lift your hands to the ceiling, wrists facing me,” she said sternly with furrowed eyebrows.Our coach was a short, assertive woman who we didn’t want to mess with. She examined each student’s wrists, frowning and shaking her head as she paused in front of some students longer than others. At the completion of the circle, she told us to sit down. She proceeded to talk to other teachers and coaches in the corner of the gym, their faces contorting in apparent disdain and disgust.No one ever told the class what the purpose of this exercise had been. Those with secrets under the cloth coverings — those of us who were struggling with self-harm — knew. We were hiding the secret cries for help marked on our wrists. After the exercise, no adults followed up with the students who appeared to have injuries. In retrospect, this exercise seems to have been nothing more than forced exposure for the sake of gossip. I know there was no action to help the hurting teens because I was one of them.A year or two later, this coach became the principal of my school. When I needed mental health treatment, I spoke to this principal and poured my heart out, despite my past experience with her. She wrote everything down and nodded a lot. She gave no advice. Venting helped me feel a little better, but she offered me no solutions or support.She wasn’t qualified to give me the help I needed and should not have been the person I was sent to. I needed a trained mental health provider.Things have changed exponentially for students since I was in high school. My experience was before the year 2000, before social media and long before the COVID-19 pandemic. A study published in February of 2019 found that in 2016, half of youth with a treatable mental illness did not receive treatment in the past year.From the start of the pandemic, mental health related emergency department visits by youth aged 12 to 17 jumped 31%. With more than $190 million in pandemic relief funds going to schools, some funds should be going to addressing mental health issues. And some states, including Ohio, Georgia, Maryland and Arizona, are leading the way by using some of these funds to improve mental health care in their schools.While many of us remember having “school counselors,” as most schools have one on staff, these professionals are not necessarily employed to deal with mental health issues. Most often, school counselors help with academic success and career planning. Students also need school psychologists, who have specific mental health training, for when they are struggling with their mental health.This could be in the form of individual education planning (IEP) for disabled students to ensure they have the support they need or individual and group counseling. There is a critical shortage of school psychologists with an average of one for every 1,211 students in the U.S. The average public school has 526 students (that translates to one psychologist essentially being responsible for the care of 2.3 schools). Some states have a ratio of one psychologist to 5,000 students.As IEPs are legally required, it would be easy to understand if school psychologists only had time for these, and no time for counseling or staff collaboration, especially given these ratios. Some of the pandemic relief funds, among other school funds, could be used to hire more school psychologists to improve these gaps in care and prevention for students.Given the amount of time that they spend with their students, school staff members have the opportunity and responsibility to recognize and act on warning signs of mental health crises in students. Staff should be provided with and participate in trainings to learn the warning signs of a crisis and how to respond effectively. Better yet, staff should be educated on early warning signs before a crisis occurs.Perhaps most importantly, school staff must challenge themselves to combat internalized stigma surrounding mental health. If an education professional (and likely, a trusted adult) approaches a mental health situation with judgment, students may feel invalidated and replicate this stigma in their own lives. In contrast, if a teacher approaches mental health topics with compassion and empathy, they create a healthier culture in which students will ask for the help they need.Additionally, students should be given access to mental health crisis hotlines and mental health services within the school and the wider community.The CDC defines Social Emotional Learning (SEL) as developing the skills to recognize and manage emotions, learning to set and achieve a positive goal, learning to appreciate the perspectives of others, establishing and maintaining positive relationships, and making responsible decisions.This approach — which prioritizes self-awareness, self-management, relationship skills, social awareness and responsible decision making — is integrated into many school systems. Estimates suggest that schools and school systems spend about $640 million on SEL-related initiatives each year. However, while SEL can promote mental wellness, it is not a substitute for mental health treatment.While there are noted benefits of SEL, the need for school psychologists is arguably greater. Some SEL funds could be allocated to the foundation of mental wellness: mental health care and treatment. We need a ratio of more psychologists to less students. These trained psychologists should then act to educate both staff and the student body to recognize and treat mental illness in the school.My high school experience should have been different. I recognize that the coach and her colleagues may not have known how to appropriately handle the situation. That’s why this conversation is important. School staff members need to educate themselves on these matters for the safety and well-being of the entire community of their schools.I encourage parents to talk to staff and school board members, share concerns and ask questions. Everyone in the community has a vested interest in the care of students by way of their tax dollars and the shaping of their community. Even if you are not a teacher or parent, you have a right to learn, care and speak out about the students’ mental well-being in your community.Ginger Robertson is a registered nurse and mental health blogger.
