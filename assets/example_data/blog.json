      "body": "Child sexual abuse is often perpetrated by someone the child knows and depends on, resulting in a type of betrayal that can lead to long-lasting difficulties for the survivor. According to Betrayal Trauma Theory, a violation of trust and safety (like child sexual abuse) within a high-dependency relationship overwhelms a person’s ability to cope. This results in the survivor experiencing symptoms like dissociation, impaired memory and even a feeling of an unbalanced or fragmented personality.Since child sexual abuse takes place within relationships, survivors tend to experience relational difficulties well after the abuse. Examples include: difficulty forming and maintaining relationships, difficulty building trust, overly attuning to another person’s needs at the expense of their own and more. For any survivor, trying to connect with others in the aftermath of abuse may be difficult. For the survivor who experienced abuse within a historically marginalized community, however, the difficulty of building connections may be even more complex.To buffer against oppressive experiences, marginalized community members may develop a sense of intracultural trust with one another: a sense of reliance, safety, protection, loyalty and kinship. According to Cultural Betrayal Trauma Theory (CBTT), having intracultural trust is an important strategy for survival within an oppressive system. However, abuse can still occur within oppressed communities, resulting in a unique form of betrayal called cultural betrayal trauma.In this form of betrayal, not only is the survivor betrayed by a person whom they believed would protect them, but they may also be betrayed by other members in the community who attempt to conceal the abuse to protect the collective (i.e., intracultural pressure). Historical events in which marginalized communities were targeted by systems, such as the legal system, has led to distrust among many communities. In turn, this may further impact relational difficulties the survivor experiences, including their sense of protection and safety within their community.Despite the relational difficulties that result from child sexual abuse, connection and belonging are vital human needs. Survivors may experience a longing for relationships, even though they may be afraid of them. The process of moving toward connection may be difficult as the journey involves not only learning how to connect with others, but also with ourselves. Below, I offer things to remember for those of you who are taking this journey of healing:You Are Not AloneWhile it may often feel isolating and lonely, please know that there are others out there that may relate to your experiences. Current estimates of child sexual abuse are in the U.S. are 1 in 4 among girls and 1 in 13 among boys. However, these rates may be even higher as child sexual abuse is vastly underreported. If we consider the additional layer of “keeping things in house” in marginalized communities, rates of underreporting may be even higher still. In other words, there may be more people out there who can relate to your pain than you think.It’s Not Your FaultSurvivors often grapple with feeing like they had done something to “deserve” the abuse. However, such feelings of guilt are often taught and instilled by others. People in your life may have been “gaslighting” you (or saying you were the problem), not believed you or even blamed you for the abuse. However, you must remember: It is never ok for a child to be abused.You may also have received messages from broader society that this was your fault due to stereotypes, hypersexualization and infantilization of your identities (e.g., gender, sexual orientation, race, ability). Thus, recognizing when thoughts of self-blame come up is vital to start discerning where that guilt is coming from and begin creating space for more self-compassion.You Deserve to Be Heard, Believed and ProtectedBeing sexually abused by someone who was supposed to love and protect the child can be extremely confusing and disruptive to how worthy a survivor feels. Survivors who were further denied protection by other adults in their lives may feel like their experiences don’t matter and, in turn, that they don’t matter.Have you ever felt this way? Shame from child sexual abuse often embeds itself deeply into the nooks and crannies of the survivor’s sense of who they are. So much so that shame can get in the way of loving yourself, despite your generous offerings of love and compassion to others. Thus, engaging in daily practices that help to build self-compassion are paramount for healing. For tips on how to foster self-compassion, see here.You Learned Ways to Protect Yourself — and That’s Incredible.Detecting signs of danger is something that was developed and often necessary for surviving sexual abuse as a child, as well as navigating an oppressive society. Due to the dire need for safety, you may have relied on protective strategies frequently, and they quickly became second nature. Examples of this behavior include:If we think of how old you were at the time of the abuse, we can start to see just how incredible it was that “little you” figured out how to survive. Yes, such strategies may not be as helpful in other situations where abuse is not occurring, particularly in adulthood (like at work, school, friendships, or even when interacting with strangers). However, acknowledging the ways that you have protected yourself in a non-shaming way can be a step toward healing.It’s Ok to Ask for HelpHealing from child sexual abuse is a dynamic journey. While there may be several reasons to distrust others, consider reaching out to people who can offer a private and confident space for you to share your story. You don’t have to be silenced anymore. If you were abused by someone within your family and/or community, consider looking outside of that circle. Examples include a religious or spiritual group, survivor support group, mental health agencies focused on supporting survivors, mentor, family member, friend, hotline or therapist. You don’t have to do this alone.Amira Y. Trevino, M.Ed. (she/her) is a doctoral candidate in Counseling Psychology.

      "body": "Recovery from psychosis typically requires medicinal and therapeutic intervention: medication to target cognitive recovery and therapy to help with emotional recovery. I believe that true emotional recovery is a gradual process and a personal journey that takes time and work beyond a written treatment plan.Your whole world — and your understanding of it — can be turned upside down by a psychotic break when a  “different” reality takes over. Afterwards, you might constantly question your current reality, remembering that a false reality forced you into a hospitalization and medication regimen. Maybe you recall how you said and did things that, normally, you would never do — so you doubt yourself and worry that other people doubt you, too.Ultimately, psychosis can leave you feeling like your mind has betrayed you or been hijacked. You may feel at the mercy of your brain and chemical processes that medicine can help but not always completely fix. Amid all this confusion and doubt, it is understandable that you might worry if you can depend on your mind to function regularly ever again. You may even blame yourself, as it is nearly impossible for us to separate our minds from our authentic selves.So, how do I define “emotional recovery” as someone living with serious mental illness (SMI)? Emotional recovery means accepting who you are after your episode, learning to trust yourself, believing in yourself again and feeling happy just being yourself.During my own recovery, one of the biggest challenges was how I constantly questioned, scrutinized and analyzed everything I said and did around other people — to the point where I could not enjoy myself around others. I was so scared of saying anything “off” or “unusual,” revealing to people that something was “wrong” with me or that I was still struggling with my mental illness symptoms. This fear was legitimate; my illness did not go away overnight — it took years of consistent medication use and counseling before I was completely out of the woods. So, I lived in fear of being misunderstood.I’m in a better place now where I feel more confident, but that progress required a big step: accepting that I may never be exactly “the same person” that I was before psychosis. I am beginning to believe my new normal is right for me for this time and place in my life. I have come to believe that part of emotional recovery is realizing that adapting to a new normal makes you a survivor — and you should feel proud of that. It’s ok if you are not the same person you were before psychosis. Maybe you were always intended to become the person you are now.Trusting yourself is key to your quality of life — but it can be hard to trust yourself when your mind has failed you. Your mind controls everything you say, do and think. It controls your direction, your safety and how you present yourself to other people. Unsurprisingly, then, losing control of these processes and behaviors can create a sense of distrust. This can easily lower self-esteem, compounding any existing mental health issues.To develop authentic trust in myself, I had to be patient and wait for positive experiences to build upon each other to strengthen my confidence. One successful situation, like navigating conversations in a group of people, gave me more motivation and confidence to take on another. Eventually, I felt more comfortable being myself, and I began to relax. When a situation did not work out well, I had to give myself grace and trust that the next opportunity would be different because I was improving. I had to believe in my ability to return to the life I once knew.Trusting and believing in yourself go hand in hand, but believing in yourself takes the process a step further to finding empowerment. Your ability to believe in yourself and choose life, with all things considered, is a choice that can’t be taken away from you. Believing in yourself gives you strength and enables you to do what it takes to recover.To recover, I had to believe that I have value as a person, and that I matter, even if I have a stigmatized diagnosis. I had to realize that even though I had experienced something that most people are afraid of and don’t understand, my life could still be redeemed, and I could have a future. Sometimes, I struggled to convince myself that I could have a future, but I decided that, deep down, it was better to try and fail than to not try at all. You have to believe in yourself to persist against the odds and possess a relentless hope that you will succeed.It is so easy to feel like a human anomaly when going through a psychotic break (or recovering from one). It can be tempting to look around at everyone around you and tell yourself that they are “normal” and you are not. It can be so easy to ask, “why me?” and “why am I being singled out like this in a way that is so bizarre?” You may feel like your life isn’t good enough or you might even wish to have a life other than your own — one that feels less “flawed” or ridden with social stigma.I felt all these things for so long. For the first time, though, I can say with confidence that it is good and right to be me. My life is not a mistake — and good things have come out of my life that outweigh the bad. I can never truly make sense of what happened to me, but I have finally let go, because I have too many other great things to hold onto that are pulling me forward.Emotional recovery from psychosis is so vital, yet not always emphasized. Trusting and believing in yourself again is one in the same with this healing process. It is an inward journey guided by patience with and love for yourself.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "“I shared my story for this book because when I needed it, it wasn’t there, and I want it to be there for others.”Nearly every contributor to NAMI’s first book, “You Are Not Alone,” shared this sentiment with us at some point during the interview process. “You Are Not Alone” featured real stories from more than 125 individuals and families, leveraging the power of lived experience to create a compassionate, authoritative guidebook on navigating the world of mental health and mental illness. We heard from people at all different stages in their recovery journeys — and everyone had a unique perspective and story to share.While working on “You Are Not Alone,” we ran into a tricky topic: How to best address the mental health and well-being of young people. With so many layers of complexity, it felt like an issue that deserved its own book.In recent years, youth mental health has emerged as a topic of urgent importance. One in six U.S. youth aged 6-17 experience a mental health disorder each year and 50% of lifetime mental illness begins by age 14. Hearing from young people about their experiences with mental illness — and the work they are doing to combat stigma — was profoundly compelling. We also heard from parents about the lessons they’d learned navigating mental health issues with their children. Ultimately, they wanted to share their wisdom with other parents and caregivers.Now, NAMI’s Associate Medical Director, Dr. Christine Crawford, is writing a follow up to “You Are Not Alone” focusing on the mental health of children and adolescents. Primarily intended for caregivers of youth in all capacities (including parents and other family members, educators, clinicians and more) the book will set its readers up with a holistic and comprehensive understanding of child and adolescent mental health.It will provide strategies for engaging with children and teens about their mental health, answer common practical questions about how to best provide support and, continuing in the NAMI tradition of lived experience expertise at the forefront, will feature the voices of real people who choose to share their stories.We are still interviewing individuals and families with lived experience.

      "body": "People who have experienced abuse can struggle with the ability to trust others. A common refrain from trauma survivors is: If I was hurt by someone who was supposed to take care of me, how can I trust anyone else?Unsurprisingly, some will cope by relying only on themselves. For example, I’ve worked with countless trauma survivors who describe themselves as excellent \"planners.\" They are the friend who designs the itinerary ahead of time, or the family member who diligently researches every option. For these individuals, their planning skills serve to help them feel empowered and in control, which is particularly important in the long-term recovery from abuse. One of the most influential interventions of trauma-informed care is restoring a sense of power and control over time in different aspects of a survivor’s life. By reclaiming their control, a survivor is undoing some of the long-term damage done by their abuser. Many survivors find healing in gaining independence, autonomy and self-worth.Since 2020, however, COVID-19 has brought to light an interesting tension: How can we rely only on ourselves when our health is dependent on the behaviors of the people around us?People have been encouraged (or required) to get vaccinated, wear masks, socially distance, etc. as a way to maintain individual health and safety — but also protect the greater good. And our individual safety relies on a widespread commitment to these protocols. There is only so much sanitizing and masking I can do to keep myself safe. If someone else chooses to enter the room I'm in, my health is now dependent on that person's actions.This can be extremely anxiety-provoking for someone who already struggled to trust people before this global public health matter.Survivors of interpersonal abuse — like sexual violence, intimate-partner abuse or family abuse — may have noticed an increase in anxiety in the last few years. They may have even noticed increased conflict in their relationships or a decreased ability to trust new people in their lives. Collectively, we have had to rely on other people during this pandemic, which can be exceedingly difficult for someone who has been working on trauma recovery.To those who are navigating this complex situation while coping with past trauma, there is hope. Unfortunately, there's no easy solution to addressing this increased anxiety, but what you can focus on is strengthening your confidence in what you can control. If it feels good to wear three masks at the same time, then do it. If it brings you comfort to sanitize your packages before bringing them into your home, then do it. Your sense of safety and control matters.Survivors I’ve worked with have told me that they want to do these things, but they’re afraid of being judged. People may roll their eyes or make unhelpful comments, but there’s no shame in prioritizing your self-care. You can’t control the behaviors of others, but you can control what you do to make yourself feel better.If actions like these are starting to impact your ability to perform daily tasks or strain your relationships, then perhaps it's gone too far — and you may want to consider talking to a mental health professional to develop more effective tools for dealing with your trauma. But if not, then pause and try to consider them as positive coping mechanisms. Try to let go of self-judgement and own the power of self-care. Your trust issues of others may still be triggered, but at least you’ll know that you are doing what you can to maximize your safety and health.Rachel Sullivan, LCSW is a clinician with 10 years of experience providing psychotherapy to survivors of sexual violence, intimate-partner abuse and other crimes, as well as consultation to medical providers.

      "body": "When Cathy Malchiodi, Ph.D., Director of the Trauma-Informed Practices and Expressive Arts Therapy Institute, prepares for an upcoming therapy session, she needs the room to be comfortable. This requires some set up; she arranges props, makes space for movement and organizes art supplies. As her institute’s name suggests, Malchiodi specializes in expressive arts therapy, an integrated therapeutic approach that incorporates movement, sound, enactment, storytelling and visual arts to support trauma recovery.In a first-time session, Malchiodi introduces her client to the items in the room and gauges their comfort level. If the client appears to feel safe in the space, she encourages them to try an activity, like drawing a doodle on a piece of paper or communicating through movement.As the dialogue surrounding mental health conditions and treatment evolves and expands, practitioners and patients alike are increasingly using the expressive arts as a method to address trauma. This method can be effective for a wide audience, primarily because it offers an alternative to immediately identifying and verbalizing emotional pain.Malchiodi found that many of her clients struggled to speak about themselves in therapy; often, the words to describe their trauma and their challenges were simply not available to them.“Expressive therapies allow a nice jumping off point to get people to tell stories about what’s happened,” she says. “They start to access and reconnect those parts of the brain that may not have been accessible.”This “reconnection” is evident in research addressing neurobiological theory. A 2014 study, for example, found that this kind of narrative and physical processing facilitates the rebalancing of dysregulated responses to stressors and trauma impacts.Malchiodi says that expressive arts allow patients to make a connection to both their therapists and to their own experiences that they may have been avoiding or suppressing — and this connection is often difficult to establish in more “typical” therapeutic interventions.“When you’re moving with somebody, when you’re making sounds together — whether you’re drumming or even listening to music together — you’re in relationship with them,” Malchiodi explains. “That was the piece that I found missing from talk therapy alone.”Once this relationship happens, patients are often able to access the language to identify and work through their trauma. “Talk is about the higher brain. And if that part of the brain is not immediately accessible, you have to work with the senses,” Malchiodi says, “Sensory integration means that clients can engage in movement or sound to work their way up from senses to feelings and thoughts.”While arts-based interventions and improvisation/enactment exercises are often perceived as therapies for children, Malchiodi has found that expressive arts therapy can benefit a wide range of help seekers. Naturally, children have proven to respond well to movement and creative expression, as they don’t have the language to quantify or qualify their trauma. But, as Malchiodi points out, this intervention can be successful to any individual struggling to talk about their experiences.Additionally, the person does not have to be adept at the expressive arts. In fact, Malchiodi resists using the word “creative” when helping her clients to express themselves in new ways.“A lot of us feel like we aren’t creative — I even have an art background, and there are days when I wake up and don’t feel creative,” she explains. “What I tell my patients is that what we’re talking about here is being expressive, and everybody can be expressive. You can just make a line on a piece of paper or a gesture with your hand, and you’re being expressive.”Additionally, Malchiodi has found expressive arts to be particularly effective in her work with the Department of Defense. She says that veterans have embraced the arts as a way to heal — something she would not have guessed in her early days of mental health work. While clients were often apprehensive about an unfamiliar type of therapy (and some were resistant to opening up), they ultimately found ways to express the stress and pain they were unable to verbalize with their loved ones.Like many other practitioners, Malchiodi has found adapting to the telehealth model during the COVID- 19 pandemic to be a challenge. Between standard internet connectivity glitches and physical distance, the dynamic between client and therapist is inherently different — and in the world of expressive arts, virtual sessions change the nature of possible activities. However, Malchiodi and her fellow providers have managed to embrace virtual sessions by focusing on particular exercises.“It would not be a great use of my time to have someone to hold up a drawing to the screen,” she explains. “But I do a lot more connection exercises with people. We can use movement and sound and do those kinds of sensory things.” This type of exercise ranges from acting out scenarios to moving to music — anything that can engage the senses while translating over video conferencing.Importantly, this shift to telehealth has had some upsides; specifically, opening up accessibility of mental health services. “It’s given an opportunity to people who normally would have had a hard time getting to a clinic,” Malchiodi says, “More and more people can find expressive arts therapy and begin to address their trauma.”Margot Harris is a Content Manager with the Marketing and Communications Department at NAMI.Note: This article was originally published in the Spring 2022 Issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "It’s 5 a.m. and my mind is lit up like a Christmas tree. I’ve been glancing at the clock on the wall periodically since 1 a.m. while I panic about functioning during a workday that is fast-approaching. My daughter is sleeping next to me, peacefully, dreaming of what I hope is nothing but happiness. I hope she never experiences the nightmare my mind has been conjuring up for the past four hours.The grief, horror and hopelessness that is racing through my body grips my heart, forcing me to fixate on my fears, regrets and failures. The fact that I’m letting my daughter co-sleep with me, something I said I would never do as a new mother, feels like reminder of yet another thing I’m failing at. The truth is, living with mental illness adds many challenges to the joy of parenthood.If you have ever suffered from anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, grief or all of the above, you can probably relate. Maybe you’ve experienced the intrusive feelings of worthlessness or felt the overwhelming presence of a cloud that darkens even the brightest corners on the sunniest days. Perhaps you recall the feeling in the pit of your stomach and the tightening of your chest. Or maybe you remember the time when you couldn’t feel anything.I often think about how well we conceal this kind of pain; you can be laughing and appear “totally fine” on the outside, while feeling like everything is falling apart on the inside. Weathering the ups and downs can feel like riding a rollercoaster. Many of us know the feeling of smiling while holding back tears, waiting for the moment when it is appropriate to let it all out, maybe in the car on the drive home or in bed once your household is fast asleep.We experience the apprehension of what horrible news will come next or ruminate on how to prevent your child from ever feeling as low as you do today. Sadly, many of us feel the regret of having brought a beautiful, vibrant, happy life into this complex world — while having little control over the possible “bad things” that will happen to them during their lifetime.As I work toward recovering from a particularly rough bout of my depression, and transition through the stages of grief once again, my nights are becoming more peaceful and manageable. My emotional rollercoaster is slowing down, and my thoughts are slowly returning to hope and happiness — for both me and my daughter.I’m able to feel the joy and anticipate the amazing things that will happen to my daughter as she grows and navigates her precious life. I’m able to laugh and smile without holding back tears or dreading the return of hopelessness that lurks around the corner. I’m able to see the sunlight permeate the dark corners again, and it feels like a weight has been lifted off my chest. I can breathe again.I know this won’t be the last of my depression. I’ve experienced anxiety and depression for over half my life. It’s something that could easily creep in next time I experience loss, feel shame from a mistake I’ve made or for no identifiable reason at all other than physiology and the cycles of a chronic illness.Nobody is immune to the curveballs of life, and I believe we all contend with emotional rollercoasters at times; some of us simply experience them more often and more intensely than others. My hope is that, if this resonates with you, if you are currently unable to glimpse the light around you, that you hold on and ride it out for yourself and for your children. Because it can, and does, get better. There is joy in our futures.Laura Anderson is the Adult Rehabilitative Mental Health Services (ARMHS) and aftercare supervisor for the mental health department at Creative Care for Reaching Independence (CCRI), an organization that offers community-based mental health support.

      "body": "Rosalyn Carter once said, “There are only four kinds of people in the world: those who have been caregivers, those who are currently caregivers, those who will be caregivers and those who will need caregivers.”Caregivers, also known as “home care workers,” strengthen our communities by providing care, companionship and support for older adults and people with health conditions and disabilities. A caregiver’s work allows their clients to live at home with dignity, while providing peace of mind to their families.Like many essential roles, caregiving is physically and emotionally taxing. Amidst the demands of caring for others, caregivers’ mental health is overlooked. In fact, estimates show 40-70% of caregivers have depressive symptoms, with 25-50% of caregivers meeting criteria for major depression. This can be due to compounding stressors, like time or financial constraints, social isolation inherent to the job and limited support systems.An understanding of the unique challenges of the profession, and its structural policy gaps, can inform the work to build systems to support caregivers’ mental health.Many caregivers say they “fell into” this work but continued doing it because they found their calling. Despite the passion they feel, the challenges are significant. As Brittany Williams, a caregiver from Tacoma, Washington shared, “People don’t understand that, when you’re a caregiver, you’re literally using every part of your body and energy and strength to take care of people.”This strain was exacerbated by the COVD-19 pandemic. A recent study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows two-thirds of unpaid caregivers experience mental health symptoms, such as depression or anxiety, compared to one-third of the non-caregiving population.While more than one in five Americans are unpaid caregivers, those who are paid — either for supporting a loved one or a client — receive modest wages. As one of health care’s lowest paid professions, caregivers may need to work long hours to make ends meet, often leading to physical and emotional exhaustion. Those caring for a loved one may navigate difficult emotions, including loss of control, isolation or the feeling that caregiving is all-consuming.Compounding these challenges is the historical reality that caregiving has been seen as the benevolent duty of female family members or the responsibility of exploited labor rather than a health care profession worth investing in. Many assumptions related to workloads and compensation that underlie caregiving have their origins in slavery, when Black women provided care without pay. These attitudes persist in today’s home care workforce in which Black women continue to be overrepresented.Additionally, caregiving was one of the few professions left out of the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, meaning generations of caregivers have been without the support and protections many workers depend on.These factors contribute to a profession that has lacked infrastructure to support the wellness of its workers who are often women of color and immigrants who may already face structural barriers to health equity and economic inclusion.Our families and communities need caregivers. And for caregivers to be successful, they (like any profession) require systems that support their well-being and sustain them in their work.We all have a role to play in building this solution. SEIU 775 Benefits Group, a nonprofit organization supporting 50,000 caregivers in Washington state through training, health, retirement and job-matching benefits that I have the honor of leading, is committed to supporting caregiver mental health in the face of the profession’s challenges and structural gaps.Here are four areas where we’ve found success — and where we hope other organizations will follow suit:Teaching skills to work with stress: One effective way to support the mental health of caregivers is to provide practical tools to work with stressors. Mindfulness has been shown to promote calm, relaxation and better sleep. By integrating mindfulness training into our courses, caregivers learn skills to identify and work through emotional challenges. Among participating caregivers, we’ve seen decreases of 20% in depression scores, 16% in perceived stress and 21% in insomnia severity.Prioritizing access to care: The ability to see an affordable therapist is often a barrier to accessing mental health support. Despite our country's advances in providing access to health care, there’s still a societal norm that high-quality care is primarily for full-time white-collar workers. But all workers need and deserve health care. In our experience, providing access to affordable, quality health care significantly shifts caregivers’ ability to proactively care for their well-being.Meeting caregivers where they are: For caregivers without health coverage or with limited insurance, high costs and long wait times present obstacles. Even those with good insurance may struggle to find culturally or linguistically appropriate therapists or feel uncomfortable seeking traditional therapy.With this in mind, we normalize emotional wellness in our communications and training and regularly connect caregivers with low-or-no-cost resources. This includes access to emotional health coaching through a third-party phone app. Of our users who screened positive for depression, 76% showed improved symptoms after six-weeks of use. Resources like these can be a game-changer for caregivers needing in-the-moment support or feeling stigma related to mental health.Focusing on economic security: Financial security lays a foundation for mental health. Yet, caregivers often don’t get this peace of mind. As a result, policies that support fair wages for caregivers, including union representation, are a crucial part of wellness. To support financial stability, we’ve adopted a first-of-its-kind retirement plan for caregivers with direct payments from their employers. And we connect caregivers to resources, such as childcare, food or legal assistance. These are important steps to reduce economic strain that can lead to mental health challenges.As the wave of aging baby boomers strains the caregiving profession and demand continues to trend upward, investments must be made to support caregivers’ well-being. Ensuring this workforce is strong, healthy and able to support our communities’ growing needs requires building systems that prioritize the wellness of caregivers, including their mental health.Abby Solomon, MSW, HCA is the CEO of SEIU 775 Benefits Group, a non-profit organization providing training, health and retirement benefits and job-matching to 50,000 caregivers in Washington state.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Until recently, I spent much of my 55 years feeling “chased” by my past, struggling to stay one step ahead of my memories. It’s a past I wanted — and needed — to run from for a long time.However, with time, I realized that I needed to heal my childhood wounds. Oftentimes, the first step in a mental health journey is to reckon with the past.In the 1970s, my father was first diagnosed with Bipolar 2 disorder — then called manic depression— which was treated with lithium and sometimes shock therapy. He was in his mid-twenties when he was diagnosed, as most people are when symptoms surface, and I was a young child.Living with a parent weathering the highs and lows of mania and depression was challenging. It was confusing to have a parent who, sometimes, was going to change the world, and other times, couldn’t get out of bed or make eye contact. Worse, my father could be a violent man — I suffered violent trauma at his hands more than once. One beating was so severe he had to send me out of town for a week so no one would see the black and blue evidence covering my body. Learning to live life walking on eggshells lead to much confusion, doubt and fear.When I was 11 years old, I lived alone with my father for a year. He didn’t come home one night. I later found out that he was in jail for lunging at a police officer and wrestling for his pistol, which was drawn. He spent the next four months in a mental health facility that was designated for “the criminally insane.” I was removed from my father’s custody at that point and moved far away. Except in pictures and flashbacks, I never saw my father again.Looking back, I realized I had three fathers. The angry, reckless one who used violence and fear as primary tools. Then there was the sullen, withdrawn one who laid in bed for days and listened to sad music, refusing to make eye contact and often talked about dying. Finally, there was the third father: The well-meaning, hard-working one, the poet who had vision and loved his kids. The father who was proud of his family and determined to give them a great life. Remembering this version of my father made forgiving all three fathers much easier.My father attempted to reunite with me years later, but the memories and fear were too great for me. He died when I was in my mid-twenties, which marked the beginning of three decades of flashbacks, panic attacks, bouts of alcohol consumption and even the occasional suicidal thought.I hid this pain well, most of the time. I tried some therapy, which was helpful, but struggled to stick with it for long. More than anything, I immersed myself in my career, academics and athletics. A distracted mind is one that can stay a step ahead of the past.However, everything changed when the COVID-19 pandemic began. My days went from being 95% full to just 5% full. For the first time, I was alone with my thoughts. When the initial shock of the pandemic wore off, and I couldn’t distract myself by looking outward, I was forced to do what I needed to do — to look inward.In January 2022, I began listening to a podcast about being able to detach from traumatic life events. Suddenly, and all at once, the sporadic therapy, the yoga, the podcasts, my own stubbornness — they all came together in an epiphany about letting go. Embracing this new approach meant I could re-visit traumatic events, instead of feeling constantly forced to re-live them in flashbacks. What a truly liberating feeling.I decided to learn more about Bipolar 2 and what determined some of my father’s behavior. How could he have ever thought it was a good idea to lunge for a cop’s gun? I often wondered. It was an enlightening day for me when I learned that people with Bipolar 2 often have an inability to comprehend the gravity of their decisions when they are in the grips of hyper-mania.While revisiting my trauma was difficult, I found solace in knowing my father had been sick when he was violent. I have come to believe that had he fully understood the consequences of his actions, he wouldn’t have been so brutal and unpredictable. This thinking allowed me to find forgiveness, adding to my new liberation. Being able to acknowledge the past and forgive has been a major step toward peace and fulfillment.I still have much mental health work to do, and I have committed myself to the following:I realize that, while I may have made great strides and had great awakenings in a short time, healing is a long-term process. All my efforts, everything I did to try to help myself, were all steps to get me where I need to be. It took me a long time to get here but I never gave up. It takes hard work and persistence to conquer trauma, but I got there, and I’m confident others can, too.Cam Scholey, MBA, CPA, is a professional writer and speaker.

      "body": "“What’s wrong with me?”That’s what my son, Ben, blurted out one day outside at his preschool. He was four years old at the time. He couldn’t tell me why he asked the question, so I tucked the incident away. Looking back, I realize that this was one of many incidents and behaviors throughout Ben’s childhood and teen years that I would tuck away, ignoring my gut instinct that he needed tools to better cope with his outbursts, intense thoughts and general sadness.Years (and many life lessons) later, I have reflected on what I wish I had done for my son to better support him as he navigated mental health challenges.Ben’s struggles began at birth with inconsolable crying. Medical professionals used the vague term “colic” to describe the hours and hours of evening crying for which there seemed to be no apparent cause or cure. (Much later I would read about a correlation between colic as a baby and mental illness). However, when Ben was about four months old, this exhausting behavior stopped and he grew, evolving as a curious, fun little guy. I assumed that things had become “normal,” and I had nothing to worry about.However, Ben would go on to face numerous mental health setbacks. Throughout elementary, middle and high school, he regularly saw a therapist and paid intermittent visits to a parenting coordinator, due to an extremely tricky, volatile divorce. I wondered if his emotional struggles were exacerbated by (or linked to) his father’s bipolar disorder diagnosis. Often, when Ben would return from a weekend visit with his biological father, he appeared agitated and was prone to outbursts or distancing behavior. He did will academically, and he had a few friends throughout school, but he lagged behind his peers emotionally and socially. I always felt that he was hard to read, as his behavior could be unpredictable.Ben expressed the pain he was experiencing in concrete terms — but I found ways to rationalize and tuck away what was in front of me. His high school senior year extended essay (a requirement to graduate with a specialized high school diploma) was titled, “Childhood Trauma and the Severity of Bipolar Disorder as an Adult.” In the piece, he wrote:“…Take, for example, a divorce. With divorce rates occurring at about one in every two marriages, it is not uncommon to find a child from divorced parents. At a young age, this can be very traumatic... This stress could cause night terrors, which in turn could cause an obsession with gore. This could also cause depression to become evident, and, paired with irritability, would cause warning flags to be raised. However, while a traumatic event such as a divorce could cause these behaviors, a therapist might write the entire thing off as unhappiness from the divorce. While simply talking to a therapist would help in the short run, the treatment may not be appropriate, and the child might struggle with depression until the disorder was properly diagnosed.”Looking back, I can see that my son was writing about his experience in plain sight. While I saw the words on the page at the time, I ignored my instincts again. Instead, I intellectualized the situation and kept Ben’s words at arm’s length. I also continued to accept his therapist’s perspective that we must not assume Ben was suffering just because his biological father had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. But Ben’s words seemed to tell a different story.Now, almost 10 years later, Ben tries to portray someone who is not suffering with symptoms of mental illness. I call this his “I’m ok” persona; he often says, “I’m fine,” when I know he’s not. I can see the way he suffers, battling severe insomnia, hygiene problems, mood fluctuations and unhealthy amounts of screen time. As a parent, I am pained to see him living with these quality-of-life inhibitors that he is not yet ready to address.When my son asked, “What’s wrong with me?!” as a preschooler, I couldn’t answer his question — but I knew he wanted help. He truly wanted to know what was wrong, but I simply wasn’t equipped to know or answer him. I often wonder how many parents travel this long, winding road: from awareness that an illness is affecting their child, to, perhaps, ignoring signs through denial, to a desperate realization that their child needs help and attempting to navigate the health care system for an illness that is so difficult to diagnose and treat.As Ben aged, I worried about health insurance; would he be able to access the necessary care once he turned 26 and was no longer on our family insurance plan? Ben recently turned 26 and, thankfully, he has a job and health insurance. For now. But we have a long road ahead of us. Does he still wonder “what’s wrong?” If he asks himself again, I can only hope that this time, he’ll want — and get — his question answered.Elise Cassie is the mother of two beautiful children, ages 26 and 18.

      "body": "This month marks my son Jacob’s 22nd year with schizophrenia. I am happy to announce that he has been one of the fortunate people who achieved the American Psychological Association's definition of recovery: good health, a stable home, meaningful work and community participation. Does he still carry remnants of the illness? Yes. But he is living an independent, productive life that was seldom possible 60 years ago.Along the way, my husband and I have learned critical lessons about caregiving as we navigated this journey with Jacob. Even as a psychologist, I had much to learn — not only about schizophrenia, but about ways in which caretakers can be an important part of the recovery process. While my husband and I do not claim to have all the answers, we believe that what we have learned could be helpful to other families coping with the challenges for caring for a loved one with mental illness.If possible, you’ll want to be an active participant in your loved one’s care. It is very common, now, for mental health professionals to include family members in the recovery process. Research shows that family support both aids recovery and can even prevent frequent relapses. Being part of the treatment team does not mean that you will attend every therapy session or that your loved one does not have the privilege of keeping some parts of their treatment private. It simply means that you have an opportunity to learn how to best promote the healing process and what role you can take in your loved one’s treatment plan to improve their experience. This could mean providing informed emotional support or taking on more logistical tasks, depending on what your loved one needs.One specific step that a family member or caregiver could take is to create a timeline and treatment log. Since someone with a serious mental illness (SMI) may need medical and psychological care throughout their lives in various degrees of intensity, doctors or therapists may retire, move or change agencies and insurance plans. Having a timeline to carry with you from one mental health practitioner to the next with information about medications, side effects and behavioral interventions (including what worked or did not work) could be useful to the new team member.We quickly learned that caregivers need support from a like-minded community. Simply put: Find a support group for yourself. My husband and I greatly benefited from NAMI's Family-to-Family Program, which connected us with other families navigating the challenges of mental illness. There are plenty of other support group options as well, many of which are virtual for those who are conscious of COVID-19 exposure. Ultimately, we found that contact with other families going through similar experiences can break the isolation that so many of us feel while coping with a family member's mental illness.Even now, some of our friends and family still do not understand mental illness, and it helps to be around those who truly do. A group can offer a place to share your sadness, frustration or good news. And it also needs to be a place to find good ideas and strategies for coping as a family. To avoid burnout, you need a place to express your feelings and people who may be able to help you find new directions to assist you and your loved one.Our family learned that it is often helpful to celebrate any positive changes that you observe in your loved one's symptoms or behaviors — whether the improvements are big or small. Sometimes this can be challenging, but it is an important perspective to cultivate for everyone’s emotional well-being. For instance, maybe your son is brushing his teeth again; perhaps a strange thing to celebrate if he is 20 or 30 years old, but this small change could be an important step for him to start practicing self-care again. Or maybe the newest medication has finally eliminated all negative voices — a big change to celebrate. By recognizing the small and the big accomplishments, you can highlight the hope (and even joy) in the recovery process.Truly, hope is what allows us to move forward. Because schizophrenia can be a complex and confusing illness, looking for rays of hope along the way is essential. I wished that I had known 22 years ago that Jacob would get better. That he would find happiness — and so would we.Having hope isn’t naïve; treatment for SMI is improving over time, and we are constantly learning new information. 60 years ago, options for people with schizophrenia were, quite frankly, dismal. Most were either hospitalized or heavily sedated with medication. Thanks to newer medical and psychological treatment approaches, 60% of people with schizophrenia achieve a level of recovery that allows them to lead productive lives.While we have a long way to go in terms of learning the origins of this illness and meeting the needs of those living with this condition, opportunities have greatly improved. Science continues to identify new medical approaches and mental health advocates are working hard to change social and political structures — paving the way for a world in which we are not burdened by stigma and limited access to care. With this momentum, the future looks bright.Linda Snow-Griffin is a retired psychologist, mental health advocate and mother of an adult son with schizophrenia.

Rural communities are typically small and friendly — and the people are fiercely independent, yet quick to come together and help their neighbors in need.Over the years, however, I was aware that there was something going on in my small farming community that people kept hidden — a taboo topic. As I eventually discovered that there were people in my community who had a relative or a friend living with an untreated mental illness, such as depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia. Yet, their struggles were met with silence because in this community — like in much of rural America — there was little information and few, if any, resources available.The wake-up call for me and my family was in 2012 with the suicide of my 28-year-old nephew, Brooks. Like so many people who live in small towns and remote areas of our country, my beloved nephew kept his suffering to himself and couldn’t bring himself to ask for help. Now, my mission is to end the suffering, silence and stigma around mental illness in rural America.The third Thursday of every November has been designated as National Rural Health Day — a day dedicated to addressing the unique health care challenges that rural residents face. Mental health is an integral part of overall health, but this critical component of our well-being is often overlooked in rural America.Rural Americans experience higher rates of depression and suicide than people who live in urban areas, but they are less likely to access mental health care services. Suicide rates among people living in rural areas are 18.3 to 20.5 per 100,000 residents — much higher than rates among people living in large urban areas (10.9 per 100,000). In addition, many rural communities have a shortage of health care providers. The following findings are a cause for concern:Mental health challenges are often made worse when coupled with other health conditions. (Comorbidities can also exacerbate an existing mental illness). The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on mental health in rural America, with 53% of rural adults and 71% of younger rural adults between the ages of 18 and 34 years reporting that the pandemic has affected their mental health.Beyond the lack of mental health resources, people living in rural areas face unique lifestyle barriers that play a role in determining whether they get the mental health care they need. They often fear negative judgement from family, friends and members of their communities (concerns include being perceived as weak or ”incompetent” if they admit to having a mental health condition). As members of small, close-knit communities, many rural residents also worry about being able to maintain confidentiality concerning a mental illness.Other rural lifestyle challenges to mental health include:The stigma associated with mental health challenges can be a major barrier to seeking help for many people living in rural communities. Some people don’t readily understand or accept that mental illness is a legitimate medical condition but rather view it as a personal weakness or character flaw. Much of the stigma surrounding mental illness is a result of this unwarranted shame, which adds to the burden for someone already suffering from mental illness.After Brooks’ passing, many of our friends and neighbors urged my family not to talk about what really happened to my nephew, to instead say that he died from natural causes. But my mother, the matriarch of our family, insisted on confronting this issue to make sure it didn’t happen to anyone else in our community.I was given the privilege of delivering Brooks’ eulogy, and I spoke in detail as to what led to his untimely death. Following the service, we had several other farm families approach us about their own journeys in dealing with mental illness and thanked us for finally giving them permission to talk openly and freely about it.Increasing awareness that mental illness is a health condition — just like cancer, heart disease or diabetes — is one way to help overcome the stigma in rural communities. In addition, talking openly with others about lived experiences with mental health challenges helps to normalize the conversation and diffuse the stigma surrounding mental illness. The simple act of sharing stories can be an important first step for people to seek help for their own mental health challenges and encourage others to admit that they are struggling.It took my nephew’s death to be my family’s wake up call, and for me to come forward and provide a voice for the often-forgotten people of rural America. While some members of our community had wanted to sweep my nephew’s tragic passing under the rug, my mom took a bold stand to talk about it with the goal of helping others. I carry on this legacy today through Rural Minds, a nonprofit organization that is committed to making a difference by pulling back the veil of silence about mental illness in rural communities.As we move forward at Rural Minds to fulfill this mission, we recognize that there are established mental health organizations, like NAMI, that provide excellent mental health information and services. Through collaboration, we are working to develop mental health initiatives to better serve the mental health needs of people in rural communities and empower rural Americans with the resources to become part of the solution to improving mental health.Jeff Winton is the Founder and Chairman of Rural Minds, a nonprofit organization that aims to end the suffering, silence and stigma surrounding mental illness in rural America.

      "body": "I am a suicide loss survivor. I have lost three family members to suicide — my cousin Craig in 2011 and his son, Aaron, in 2014. I also lost my dad, Dan, in 2012. I have felt all these losses deeply, and more than 10 years later, I still have moments that take me back to those first minutes of hearing about their deaths. I have come to the painful realization that reaching some type of “closure” from these losses is a myth. These tragedies, like other major experiences in my life, will be with me indefinitely.Losing someone to suicide is different from other types of loss, largely because of the stigma surrounding mental illness. While people won’t hesitate to discuss someone’s brave battle with cancer and include that in an obituary, those who die by suicide are often surrounded by secrecy and vague statements about how they died. The loss might even be labeled as an “accident.”Those affected by the loss may also feel isolated and alone because people who would typically be supportive during a tragedy don’t know what to do or say when a suicide occurs. The trauma associated with being a suicide loss survivor and its resulting effects can create a tough road to navigate.Every year, I see more and more groups and individuals spreading the message about suicide prevention. I applaud these efforts and admire the passion for creating a proactive approach to mental health. I also think it’s important to reflect on where we have been and what led us to this point of openly talking about it.While it would be hard to measure exact numbers, my suspicion is that most of us who are involved in suicide prevention have been touched by suicide in some way. For every suicide loss, there is an even larger number of people that are impacted by that loss. It makes sense to me that suicide loss survivors would forward a message of prevention so that others would not have to go through what they did.However, this connection brings to light a reality that I think we should all consider: Suicide is complex — there are no simple answers that explain why people die by suicide. Research is ongoing and progress is being made, but I encourage all of us to be careful about oversimplifying a message that ultimately cannot be simplified.I write these words as a reminder to myself as well because I have done this in my activism too, particularly when sharing suicide prevention messaging on social media. Other times, I have spoken of suicide in ways that try to avoid making someone uncomfortable and promote a positivity that’s not realistic. Prevention (and the hope that accompanies it) is the goal, but many suicide loss survivors understand that we are not there yet.I also want to encourage every suicide loss survivor to take some extra time to remember those we’ve lost and share some joyful stories and memories of their lives. We understand that they shouldn’t be defined solely by how they died, but for the multifaceted people that they were — just as we would happily recall the life of someone who died from a physical illness. In prevention efforts and a growing mental health conversation, there is plenty of room to include remembering, talking about and sharing our love for those we have lost to suicide as well.Craig, Aaron, my dad and I all were raised in the same town, and we spent a lot of time together. Craig was very active in the community, including in his work as a volunteer firefighter. Aaron was an outgoing young adult that could make anyone laugh. My dad was an avid hunter and considered me and my brother to be his biggest accomplishments. I miss and love them all — and that never changes.About a year or so after my dad died, I decided to use my experience to join NAMI and become a teacher for the NAMI Family-to-Family course. After teaching a few classes, I became involved in NAMI Walks as well. I joined the Board of Directors for NAMI Iowa and served as the president for a few years. During that time, I was involved in advocacy efforts at the Iowa State Legislature and contributed to multiple fundraising events. When the NAMI Provider course was offered to third-year medical students at Des Moines University, I jumped at the chance to teach again.More recently, I completed my first American Foundation for Suicide Prevention (AFSP) Overnight Walk in New York City and attended AFSP’s Long Term Survivors of Suicide Loss Summit in Cleveland. Although my family’s losses are still difficult to process, I have found a way to make meaning from them to raise awareness, educate, advocate and support.While I will never forget the loss of Craig, Aaron and my dad, I choose to remember them by sharing my story and promoting a message of hope. We haven’t reached the goal of 100% suicide prevention yet, but every day we take a few steps forward to someday make it a reality.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

The next day, my husband Isaac would be going on his first deployment to Iraq. It was 2009. We had been married for over two years and had a 12-month-old daughter. Losing the man I married — my rock and best friend — was one of my biggest fears.Those fears were realized when he returned home early from Afghanistan in 2013. He was injured; physically, mentally and emotionally. To make matters even more challenging, I developed secondary PTSD — when the loved one of someone dealing with PTSD starts to exhibit those same symptoms, including hypervigilance, anxiety, avoidance, nightmares, trouble sleeping, impatience, etc.It took years of therapy and support from other veterans and caregivers we met through Wounded Warrior Project to find ourselves — and each other — again.Injuries and trauma sustained during training and combat can change a person. Gone was the driven, reliable, caring and stable husband I married. Instead, he was angry, exhausted, moody and distant. I felt like I was living with a stranger.Neither of us understood the signs and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injury (TBI). In my husband’s small military community, invisible wounds carried a stigma. He worried he would be ostracized from his command and forced to medically retire from the career he loved. Shame, guilt and depression overcame him. It crushed him.I stopped him from two suicide attempts — something I never thought my strong husband would even contemplate, let alone try.Both times he attempted suicide, my husband was afraid of what his command would think — and how they would respond to his mental struggles. By this time, he erupted in angry outbursts over the smallest things. He started punching doors and walls when we would have disagreements. I became fearful of these fits of rage.We decided to live separately for a short time. Isaac focused on his treatments, and I focused on getting back into my fitness career, so I could financially support our family.Years of walking on eggshells and trying to keep the peace in the war that came home to us started taking a toll on my health. In 2016, I started having severe panic attacks. I worked 50-plus hours a week, managing a fitness department while also taking care of my husband’s medical needs and caring for our three children. The burden was overwhelming.I felt all alone.I was cracking, but who could take care of me? No one understood the struggles I was facing. I started to isolate myself, which only made me feel worse and depressed. I found myself in the emergency room several times.What I didn’t realize was these were similar to the struggles my husband had been plagued with for years. For the first time, I got a glimpse of his daily challenges. It fueled me to get help for both of us.This led me to Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP). I learned that I was not alone.I started to attend family support events. In May 2017, I attended a dinner with others who understood what I was going through.It was through WWP that I learned about secondary PTSD. Finally, I had a name for the symptoms I was experiencing. I realized we both needed treatment to heal ourselves, our marriage and our family.At that same dinner, I learned we could get a year’s worth of therapy in a three-week intensive outpatient program called Warrior Care Network. The program helps wounded warriors and their family support members heal from the invisible wounds of PTSD and TBI.At first, my husband was not comfortable doing more treatments. He had already been through other options with little to no improvement. However, he saw my progress as I dealt with secondary PTSD. It inspired him to fully commit to his recovery and healing. So, in April 2019, we embarked on our three-week treatment, which was a turning point for us.In this treatment program, we grew together, navigating this new normal in our lives. We were given tools and skills for when our symptoms flared. We also learned to communicate again through our changing roles. We even had our first experience with equine therapy. It sparked a dream in us.In April of this year, that dream became a reality.We purchased a 15-acre property and farmhouse. One day, we hope to help other veterans and caregivers overcome invisible wounds through equine therapy. I am getting my master’s degree in social work and becoming an equine therapist. We adopted two handsome horses. They are our best counselors.Now, when my husband has a difficult day, I’ll find him grooming his horse, Dempsey. I smile because we are moving forward with our lives. No, the symptoms of our mental health struggles aren’t gone. Yes, we still work at it daily, but it makes all the sacrifices of this life together worth it.As we navigated this difficult journey, I chose to not take his PTSD and traumatic brain injury outbursts personally. I continue to be joyful. I chose to fight for his quality of life, our marriage and our family with everything I had. I am so blessed that it has brought us here. My husband may never be the exact man I married again. I have learned it's ok because I have the best gift of falling in love with him every day.Jenna Malone lives in Florida with her three children and husband, Navy veteran Isaac Malone.

      "body": "Telling your partner about your mental health diagnosis is a big step in a relationship that is often met with anxiety, uncertainty and fear. I have first-hand experience telling the person I saw myself spending the rest of my life with that I have a serious mental illness and will be taking antipsychotic medications for the rest of my life.Here is what I have learned through my process disclosing my schizophrenia diagnosis to the man who is now my husband. I hope that my experience — and what I wish I had known — can help guide others who are making this important, brave decision.If you have the desire to share this type of information with someone, it is a sign that this person is special. Your wish to disclose likely means that you want to be real and transparent with them — to achieve greater intimacy for the purpose of a long-term relationship.If I could go back, I would tell myself that sharing this information in the first place is actually a privilege and honor to your partner. Whoever you choose to tell is fortunate to know this information. A good partner will understand the significance of you thinking highly enough of them to disclose sensitive information that leaves you vulnerable. So, the right person will see your disclosure as a good thing. And your vulnerability speaks volumes about the strength of your relationship.Understandably, you may not want to disclose because you do not know how your partner will react. Even if you don’t know how they will react, it doesn’t mean they aren’t the right person – you may just not know for sure what they know or think about mental illness. Perhaps they don’t have any first-hand experience with mental illness, and they might unintentionally see your diagnosis through the lens of stigma. It’s normal to worry that their limited experience might lead them to see you differently. Personally, I feared for the first time my partner would find out that I wasn’t “perfect,” or worse, that I have a “problem.”I understand why disclosing this information is so hard. Maybe your relationship is the best thing to happen to you in a long time, and you don’t want to take the risk. Of course, it would be painful to find out that your partner doesn’t accept you and your diagnosis. Rejection can make us feel as though our past and current mental health status keeps us from finding the love and happiness we are looking for. We don’t want someone to look at us and worry that we could be untrustworthy or relapse.However, it’s better to know sooner if your partner would reject you as you don’t want to waste your time with someone who won’t accept your illness. Your time is just as precious as your partner’s, and you won’t truly know if your partner is the right person for you until they know and accept you fully — including your diagnosis.The truth is: while your illness does not define or identify you, the act of hiding information about yourself is emotionally draining. Concealing information about yourself takes energy that could be directed to growing your relationship instead. Beyond the exhaustion of hiding a diagnosis, you will likely experience undue anxiety about your partner finding out before you decide to tell them.From my experience, I can say that withholding that information can slow down or impede your relationship. By resisting sharing my diagnosis, I was putting the brakes on my relationship without meaning to; I was holding back, afraid of him rejecting me and my mental illness history.I revealed information incrementally over the course of two years, because I wanted my partner to really get to know me — and he could see how well I was doing despite the challenging diagnosis. While this method certainly led to a successful relationship, I still wish I had disclosed sooner.Ultimately, the right partner will admire your courage to face your illness and your persistence to seek treatment. They will know your limitations and imperfections — and they will love those parts of you as well.In the process of disclosing my diagnosis and growing my relationship with my partner, I realized that not having a picture-perfect past has turned into a gift. I know I am loved, regardless of societal stigma, hospitalizations and labels. I feel so fortunate to experience a kind of unconditional love that surrounds me regardless of setbacks — and I would prefer that to being considered “perfect.” Now, I know my husband fully knows and accepts me for exactly who I am, and my disclosure gave him the opportunity to show how much he loves me and believes in me.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "My son is a missing person. His face doesn’t appear on the back of a milk carton or on a flyer at the post office, but he’s missing, nonetheless.I haven’t seen him in over two years, and I don’t know if I will ever see him again.But I hear from him every day. He calls regularly. In fact, he calls too often. He wants to tell me about his suffering: his left leg that he’s sure is shorter than the right one, his eyebrow that twitches, the microbe under his thigh, the neighbors who are listening to him, the mailman who wants to harm him. The list of his troubles always goes on even though it changes constantly.I suppose I should be happy that I hear from him. At least I know he’s alive and well enough to worry about these things. But I miss him — and I want him back.Two years ago, my son fled through his apartment window. Like a thief making a quick getaway, he climbed out of the window with a duffle bag full of clothes, his laptop and his phone. I didn’t think it was possible for him to get away. The window was small. His apartment was on a major street. But when I showed up with the police, a locksmith and a social worker, he knew I was there to have him hospitalized. That compelled him to find a way to escape — by any means necessary.Being hospitalized was, and still is, his greatest fear. That’s why he evades me and the rest of his family, the people he’s closest to. He knows we’ll try to get him inpatient treatment again if we get the chance. That’s why, when he saw me with his would-be “captors,” he took off. First on foot, then by bus and train and, eventually, by plane.His movements surprised me. I thought someone with his appearance — a mass of hair on his head, a long beard and fingernails that look like claws — would draw suspicion during his travels. He looks nothing like the handsome young man in his passport photo. But so far, no one has tried to intervene.After a week of traveling, he turned up in Anchorage. We knew because we could monitor his movements through his cell phone. The extent of his travel was an amazing feat for someone who experiences paranoia and delusions much of the time. He told me he went to Alaska because it was too hot in Los Angeles, and he wanted to live someplace cool. He said he chose Alaska because he needed to live in a state that began with the letter A, the same as his first name. Arizona and Alabama are too hot, so Alaska was his best option. Besides, it was far from me and the rest of his family.My son is missing — not because he was abducted, but by choice, his and mine. I could find him if I wanted to. He’s gone, but financially dependent on me. I could withhold support until he agreed to see me. But what good would that do? I can’t force him to do anything — cutting off support would simply ensure that he struggled financially, as well as emotionally. He calls me often, because he is bored, lonely and suffering. He calls because I will answer. In fact, he calls me every day.I listen as he tells me his fears and ailments, but he rejects my advice for treatment, especially if it involves seeing a doctor. He won’t accept my suggestion to take a walk outside because he never leaves his apartment. He’s afraid of the dangers his mind conjures up.So, he stays inside and calls his uncles, aunts, cousins, old friends, classmates from grade school that he can track down through social media and co-workers who forgot about him years ago. He’s desperate for someone who will listen to him, and he’s running out of options. The number of those who are willing to speak with him has shrunk with time because all his contacts are moving on with their lives, and not many are able to handle hearing his difficulties.My son has taught me a painful lesson: to accept the things I cannot change. It took me some time to embrace the lesson, but once I did, it eased my own suffering. A few years ago, a friend told me not to worry about my son. “Worry isn’t good for you or him. Be concerned, but don’t worry because there’s not much you can do.”Doctors have told me to be happy for what we have. He’s not living on the streets. He hasn’t been beaten up or arrested. He knows how to cook for himself, order food online and manage the life he has. “You should be grateful,” a well-regarded psychiatrist told me recently. “It could be far worse.”It’s hard to imagine, but I suppose he’s right. I see so many people, especially young men of color like my son, living on the streets of Los Angeles; battling psychosis and suffering. When I see them, I give thanks that my son isn’t out there too.Still, I miss him, especially the son I knew when he was a child. He was sweet, thoughtful, kind and a pleasure to be with. But he’s gone — and I must accept that I may never get him back. We spoke this morning, and he was in a good mood. In fact, he laughed when I said hello because he thought there was an echo. Then he began telling me his current list of problems. I listened, just happy to know that he’s alive and as ok as he will be for some time to come.Pedro Noguera, Ph.D. is the Dean of the Rossier School of Education at USC.

      "body": "For better or for worse, our parents and caregivers offer us our first and most lasting insights into the workings of being human. From the ages of three, when I first immigrated to the U.S., to eleven, I lived in a household of seven people. The men — my uncle and father — were omnipotent shades in the background. My cousin and I, the children, didn’t see them much. We just knew they were the ones to please — and the ones to avoid angering.My grandmother, mother and aunt — the women — were the ones around to pick up the day-to-day pieces. We relied on them for everything and took it all for granted. They slipped into this hierarchy they had no say in building with the same tired smoothness they used to slip through the front door after a long workday (that often exceeded the men’s workdays).The women knew the means to survival but not living. Perhaps seeing their conditioned acceptance to the blood-thick misogyny of everything in that house determined the philosophy by which I shaped myself: you are the sum of what you can do for others.In popular culture and media, we see an abundance of content related to “generational curses” that catalyze the protagonist’s journey. We’ve come to view them in the context of a set narrative rather than lived experience. The hero comes into their blood-ordained power for the first time. They grapple with it. They grow into it. They become the stuff of legends, and we can all applaud from the other side of the screen, fulfilled by the predictable satisfaction evoked by a happy ending. Intergenerational trauma is considerably more nuanced — there is no clear hero or villain, victor or victim.I love my mother. That’s the one thing I can say with certainty. Most days, however, I don’t know if I like her — and I’m sure she’d say the same about me. This is because I’m acutely aware of the fact that many, if not all, of my mental health struggles can easily be traced back to her: my anxiety, terrible body image and depression.Currently, I identify as a socially anxious introvert with an extraordinarily low battery for interaction. But the truth is, I was a relatively happy child. My home life was challenging, but I was insulated from much of the direct harm through the efforts of my mother and grandmother, for which I am forever grateful. In elementary school, I was a confident and outgoing extrovert who never had any doubts about her ability to make and maintain friendships.However, things changed when my parents divorced. My mother and I suffered. Our relationship was rocky for all of my middle school and half of my high school years. She was always working to support the two of us. I lingered in solitude for most of my adolescence and felt abandoned because of it. Being an immigrant, a single mother, and a woman of color in a racialized and fractured society is obviously not an easy task to take on. My mother was stressed, but she wouldn’t communicate. Our interactions grew strained; I would feel anxious about her coming home and picking me apart. Among this wreckage, no venerated champion emerged — only mother and daughter standing side-by-side.My experiences with intergenerational trauma inspired me in my third year of college to pursue a service-learning fellowship with Little Manila Rising, a Filipinx-based non-profit focused on bringing multi-faceted equity to the historically disenfranchised region of South Stockton. I devoted forty hours a week to the fellowship, the bulk of which was spent assisting in their Healing Pilipinx Uplifting Self and Others (PUSO) program.Healing PUSO’s commitment to destigmatizing conversations around trauma-informed and culturally competent mental health care completely shifted my worldview. For many years, I thought mental health could be summed up simply by “self-care,” “therapy” and “diagnosis.” I had no critical framework for grasping the systemic factors at play, the importance of intersectionality or the psychosocial effects of inherited historical trauma and generational marginalization.This newfound vocabulary enabled me for the first time in my life to name my experiences. It gave me the power to give them shape. More importantly, it grounded me in community. I felt so alone with my thoughts for too long. Now I know my complicated mother-daughter relationship is not an isolated one. Rather, it mirrors the struggles many immigrants and people of color face in being tasked with reconciling cultures, belief-systems and many generations of pain.As I time travel through these words, revisiting the many phases of my life, I’d like to say that besides being older, I’ve also grown wiser through the years. I will turn 21 this year. At 21, my mom was working full-time in the city, alone and away from her loved ones, to support herself and help her parents. At almost 21, I’ve never understood my mom more.Today, as a NAMI Next Gen Youth Advisor, I advocate as a representative of myself and the women who came before me who lacked the space, vocabulary and visibility necessary to incite meaningful and necessary change. I am privileged beyond words to occupy a role that I never thought was in the cards for people who looked like me growing up. Breaking cycles while breaking stigma — that’s what I’m here for.Guiying (Angel) Zhong is a current undergraduate student at the University of the Pacific majoring in Psychology and English and minoring in Writing and Ethnic Studies.

      "body": "Around three years ago, I was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD). I was attending “regular therapy,” as I like to call it, for about five and a half years — on and off with different therapists, at different clinics, and taking several medications. Eventually, I settled with one therapist. But after a year and a half of being together, she told me I would need to transfer at a different clinic where I would receive more intensive therapy. She also mentioned BPD for the first time.I hadn’t heard of this disorder before, and I wasn’t familiar with its symptoms or manifestations. It was brand new to me. What I did know was that being told to switch clinics for different treatment was hurtful. I cried during my last session, and when my therapist asked me why I was crying, I didn’t even know how to explain what I was feeling.However, after receiving this diagnosis and trying dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) for some time, I began to make progress and feel more at peace. Since starting this treatment, I have learned to recognize and sit with my emotions. Developing strategies to acknowledge my feelings has helped me accept my circumstances and live a happier life, even with its struggles.As I reflect on what I’ve learned on my ongoing mental health journey, a few lessons stick out:The fear and hurt I felt that day in my therapist’s office was familiar — I believed my therapist got tired of me and my lack of progress and hoped to get rid of me with this transfer — and it was a kind of pain I had always felt. Throughout middle school and high school, I found myself in toxic and unstable friendships, and I always felt like I was the problem.I would lash out at my friends because I often felt jealous, and I feared I would be replaced by “better people.” I had a falling out with someone I considered to be my best friend, due to my own behavior, but I blamed her for the demise of our friendship and resented her for the loneliness and pain I was experiencing. I continued to struggle to make friends. So, whenever someone new entered my life, I would do everything in power to “keep” them — even if the actual friendship was not good for me.When I entered a romantic relationship in high school, new unhealthy behaviors emerged. I believed this person was “the one,” and I constantly prioritized him so he wouldn’t leave me. Even when I was not treated well and the relationship took a toll on my well-being and the people around me, I still directed all my attention toward him, hoping he would change one day. Thankfully, this relationship did end eventually. But during that time, I would catch myself “missing” him — or to be exact, missing the feeling of having someone.As I reflect on my history, I realize that I hated the thought of anyone leaving my life and feared any kind of change. Any time someone important left my life, my world came crashing down — and I was constantly living in the past. When I was eventually evaluated and officially diagnosed with BPD, I felt like all the confusing and painful events of my adolescence and beyond finally made sense.Upon hearing the symptoms that led to my diagnosis, I felt something click. I found relief in finally knowing what was wrong — and what solutions were available to me. This diagnosis could explain some of my overwhelming feelings and fears of abandonment. It explained feelings of emptiness and self-hatred. It all finally made sense.When I attended my standard psychotherapy appointments, I often like I was in a hole. I was stuck and simply couldn’t make progress. I returned to harmful behaviors and wondered why I couldn’t change.It turns out that what I needed most was to learn how to cope with difficult emotions — something I practiced in DBT. At first, I wasn’t enthusiastic about this kind of therapy, but with time, I came to realize the value of practicing daily mindfulness rather than ignoring my emotions until moments of crisis.I also learned specific skills to put into practice when I’m struggling to manage my feelings. On skill that particularly stands out is DEARMAN — an acronym that stands for Describe, Express, Assert, Reinforce, Mindful, Appear confident and Negotiate. Following the steps described in this skill has guided me in effective communication when I’m emotionally overwhelmed or activated and feel the impulse to shut down.Another skill that I rely on is simply “checking the facts.” This entails breaking down a situation and separating the facts from your emotions and beliefs. When I’m seeing things in black and white or struggling to grasp what’s “real,” taking this step back to assess the situation brings some calm and clarity. It challenges me to recognize my emotions, observe my surroundings and view the situation from other points of view. This work can be intimidating, but I practiced this kind of mindfulness regularly, I started seeing positive changes in my life.Despite finding the right treatment, managing my mental health condition is an ongoing battle. Sometimes, I wish I had known how hard this work would be. How difficult it is to acknowledge feelings of pain and emptiness and explore their origins. How difficult it is to manage your fears of losing those close to you because of your intensity. How hard it is to be told your behavior is “toxic” or “possessive.”But I’ve also learned that I have a chance to fight stigma surrounding BPD. I have come to understand just how damaging stigma can be; indeed, finding your identity can be difficult when the world reduces you to your symptoms. These daily battles are overwhelming, but I know I can’t give up. I can change how people see this condition, and I can fight for my own well-being.To those who also have BPD, we are not alone and its always ok to reach out. Take it day by day; recovery is not something that should be rushed. And remember: progress is progress, no matter how small it may seem.Lizbeth Desantiago is 19 years old and loves learning about mental health and psychology.

      "body": "I live in an apartment complex in a busy part of my town. From my second-floor balcony, I can see my neighbors coming and going from their jobs, appointments, errands and other activities. While I have glimpses into their everyday lives, I don't really know any of my neighbors on a personal level. The extent of my interactions with my neighbors consists of the polite \"Hello, how are you?\" or \"Have a nice day,\"-type exchanges. Sometimes, I wonder what my neighbors notice about me.I live a rather isolated life, except for occasional visits from my family. I look physically fit, well-groomed and reasonably healthy. While I am noticeably less social, my mental health condition is not outwardly detectable. I often wonder how my neighbors would react if they knew I have schizophrenia.Most people know that mental illness impacts one’s thinking or behavior. However, due to the pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness, people may not know that mental health conditions can be treated (usually with a combination of medication and therapy) — and people living with mental illness can lead normal and joyful lives.I have often thought about what I wish I could communicate to my neighbors. My illness greatly affects my life — just as any physical illness would — but schizophrenia does not define me. If I could tell my neighbors anything about myself, this is what I would share:If my neighbors found out I have schizophrenia, I would want them to know that I am not a danger to them. I would want to explain that the negative portrayals of this condition in the media are misleading and sensationalized; I do not own a gun, I am not wildly unpredictable, and I am certainly not a serial killer, despite what crime dramas may suggest. In fact, research shows that I am more likely to be the victim of a crime than a perpetrator.Ultimately, I understand that the label of my diagnosis can be intimidating for people who are unfamiliar with serious mental illness — but I hope to start a dialogue and explain my situation. I would be happy to share my daily experience, from my symptoms to the medications I take.If my neighbors learned of my diagnosis, I would want them to see the complexities of me as a person. Firstly, that I am not a dangerous criminal— but more than that, I have a productive life as a writer and mental health advocate. I’ve learned and proven that words can be powerful, if used in the right way. I use my voice as an advocate to educate people about the lived experience of serious mental illness. And I am open to having difficult conversations; there is no question about my mental illness that I am afraid to answer, and if I don’t know, I do my best to find the answer.My work goes beyond mental health advocacy. I would also like for my neighbors to know that I am an American patriot; I am a veteran having served my country in the U.S. Army. I love the fact that America is a country of diversity — and much of what makes us a great country is that we appreciate the unique contributions that come from all our citizens. And I have many contributions to offer.While my life may look different from my neighbors’ lives, we have plenty of things in common. From my balcony, I can see some of my neighbors playing sports. I wish they knew that I have always enjoyed physical exercise. Specifically, I love to play basketball, and I would appreciate it if someone asked to play a game of pick-up basketball at the new court near our apartments. I also enjoy working out, and I would like to have a workout buddy when using the fitness center in our apartment complex. Not only is exercise a fun activity, but it also helps me manage my symptoms.Ultimately, I wish my neighbors knew that I have the same emotional needs as anyone else. Although they might not see lots of people coming and going from my apartment, I want them to know that sometimes I like to have company — just someone to hang out with or watch a ballgame with. I have a large collection of vinyl records and would love to show off my jazz collection to them. I also like to cook and would enjoy cooking for other people, not just myself. Maybe a neighbor and I could cook together. The combination of a homemade dinner and good jazz sounds like a wonderful evening to me.Those of us who have mental health diagnoses simply want to be seen for who we are and to feel understood when we experience mental health challenges. We are productive, well-intentioned people who make major contributions to our society every day. Since one in four people are affected by mental illness, it is safe to say that people in every rung of society struggle every day to fight the stigma that isolates us. I believe the solution exists in simply talking to those around us — to find the things we have in common.I would jump at the opportunity to explore some of those commonalities with some of my neighbors.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, S.C., where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness. Jason was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder while he was enlisted in the U.S. Army. He began his mental health advocacy with NAMI, where he received peer-to-peer certification, and he has since gone on to volunteer helping veterans who have mental health issues. Jason has written two books, and his first-person account of day-to-day life with schizophrenia has appeared in “Schizophrenia Bulletin,” an academic journal published by Oxford Press.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "As I look back on my life, I remember that younger me experienced a roller coaster of emotions — I was either on top of the world or feeling like the world was ending. Growing up as a boy actively involved in sports from a young age, I never witnessed discussions about mental well-being or managing emotions.My focus was on trying to keep up with my older brother and my friends in sports, but somehow, I always felt like I was a little bit behind or “less than” as a person. As I progressed into professional baseball, those feelings stuck with me. Even during my most successful times, it was still hard for me to feel worthy; I felt like I was constantly letting myself, or others, down.The emotional pain and depression became unbearable, and in April 2020, I attempted to take my own life. Waking up in the hospital, one of my first thoughts was, “I survived for a reason. My mission is to help other people, so they never have to get to this point.”Since then, I’ve learned so much about myself, about mental health and about treatments I didn’t even know were available, like transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). I don’t claim to be an expert, but if my experience can help even one person, I want to share it.While I grew up prioritizing physical strength and athleticism, I have since learned that there is strength in vulnerability. The courage to ask for help and take control of your struggles is a whole different kind of strength. Understanding this has allowed me to find a level of confidence I was always missing. At first, I was afraid people would see me only as someone with mental illness. That’s all they would expect me to talk about.Somehow, I believed I would lose myself, and mental illness would become my identity. Now, I realize that labels are not important. People still appreciate me for me, and my illness doesn’t define me. It took strength — emotional strength — to work past that fear.Perhaps most importantly, I have learned that getting help early is critical. Don’t wait until you’re in crisis. I wasn’t suicidal until I was, and by then, I couldn’t think clearly or logically anymore. Focusing on your mental health as an empowering, preventative practice instead of as a reactive, crisis response can help you learn about techniques and treatment options to manage your health. Having self-care routines and coping strategies in place would have helped me get through that difficult time before it became unbearable.Now, I have what I call my “trifecta” in addition to my therapy work — which consists of regular exercise, meditation and journaling. In particularly difficult situations, I seek out TMS therapy. This noninvasive procedure, which uses magnetic fields to stimulate nerve cells in the brain, has been proven to alleviate many symptoms of depression.This is what happens to work for me. What’s important is finding what works best for you. We plan for other things in our life like, physical health and financial well-being — so why not be proactive about mental health?Mental illness can be an isolating experience; often, you may feel like you’re the only one battling this kind of pain. But what I’ve learned on my mental health journey is that you’re never alone, no matter how much it may feel like you are. When you do seek help and voice your discomfort for the first time, you’ll find that there are people and tools ready to support you. These last two and a half years since my attempt to take my life, I’ve pushed myself to be open-minded and committed to getting the help I need. Ultimately, I found that people were incredibly supportive — my family, friends, teammates, doctors and therapists.This encouragement and support allowed me to wholeheartedly pursue recovery. I was even excited to try medication. Although it ultimately wasn’t the right choice for me because of the side effects, I know it is a huge aid and a very important part of the process for many people. Fortunately, my doctor told me about TMS therapy, which was a lifesaving practice. This treatment option allowed me to find more stability and feel hopeful as I continued my mental health journey. I wish I had known about TMS sooner, so I didn’t have to go through as much trial and error with medications.While the process of finding the right treatment plan can be frustrating, discovering what works best for you is lifesaving. Personally, I’ve found I do best with a combination of weekly therapy, daily self-care routines, deeper social connections and giving back by being a mental health advocate.Mental health is something I’m always working on, and it will be a lifelong journey. As I’ve progressed in my recovery, I have come to understand that mental health conditions are treatable and manageable. There are resources available, and my responsibility is to commit to being healthy.If I stick to my treatment plan and celebrate my progress, I have the opportunity to encourage others to get help too. Healing work is empowering, necessary at times and even cool. When I brag about going to therapy, I hope anyone who overhears will feel moved or more comfortable to start their own journey of becoming their best version of themselves. Connecting with people and encouraging them to open up about their feelings and experiences has become my mission. I know first-hand how transformative it can be to take that first step toward finding out that strength isn’t always physical.Drew Robinson is a former Major League Baseball player and current mental health advocate.

      "body": "I’m at a point in my recovery where I feel more comfortable in my thoughts and behaviors. I understand my health and my needs — and I have a more relaxed attitude toward life. But this wasn’t always the case.In 2012, I was struggling. I had lost my mother a year before, and I wasn’t handling the loss well. I needed to be hospitalized and was put under psychiatric evaluation for six months.As I look back on my mental health journey, I often think about the many roadblocks I could have avoided if I had simply known a few basic truths and tips. These are a few truths I learned on my road to recovery.Self-blame is a problem for many of us living with mental illness — I have dealt with it often. This tendency, I learned in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), is a common cognitive distortion — a thought pattern that is often inaccurate and negatively biased.My thought pattern manifested in me blaming myself whenever anything went wrong. Yes, there were things that may have been within my control that had been mismanaged, but most things I blamed myself for— namely, my mental illness and accompanying symptoms — weren’t the same as what I could actually control.Now, I am careful to analyze distressing situations as they arise, determining if the circumstances are something I can control. I have come to understand that I can control my own actions and responses, but I cannot control external events or hold myself responsible for others’ feelings and actions.Throughout my mental health journey, I battled another cognitive distortion: black-and-white thinking. When I would engage in black-and-white thinking, I could only interpret events in extremes; I believed that everyone and everything fell into two different categories, Good and Bad. Thinking this way forced me to divide my world and miss out on the nuances of life and the complexities of people. &I saw everyone as either a “good guy” or “bad guy” — and in the depths of my mental illness, I could only see certain people as the enemy. This often put me in a victim mindset, and I would make decisions and act out of fear and perceived danger. Thankfully my time spent in therapy has broken down that barrier and has allowed me to see that in the end, people are just people, and not everything is good or bad.Perhaps the most important lesson I learned is that treatment can be most effective when it is a collaborative process. You and your mental health professionals are a team. At the beginning of my journey, I simply took the medication that was given to me by my medical providers. I was never an active participant in my treatment.I never spoke up about negative side effects of medications or articulated my goals for recovery. As a result, I didn’t see the outcomes I wanted, so I would stop taking my medication. Slowly, my condition would deteriorate even further. I often lied to my doctors and told them I was taking the medication, rather than admitting that the side effects had become too much to handle. I seemed outwardly compliant, but I was harming myself by not voicing my concerns.Once I started to be honest with my doctor, we adjusted my medication to find a better fit. This, combined with regular therapy got me closer to the current point in my recovery. I wish I could tell my younger self that she could speak up at any time, ask questions and advocate for herself. Always remember: You are the priority in your own treatment.I believe that there is dignity in working and accomplishing tasks. And, like most of us, I was raised in a culture that valued hard work and success. But I have also learned that managing my energy — when I have too much or too little — is a critical part of my recovery. Self-care and productivity, I’ve learned, can coexist in a healthy balance.To find this balance, I had to recognize that I had a bad habit of tying my productivity and my accomplishments to my self-worth. When I would have a busy or productive day, I felt more “useful” and considered myself “good”— somehow superior to the person I was on the days when I didn’t do anything. However, the height of my “productivity” occurred during my manic episodes — it was never focused or sustainable.Now, I understand that I am not “better” when I am manic. I am better when I allow myself to rest and find consistent, healthy habits.I love the arts. Drawing and painting were always my favorite classes in high school. There’s something magical about creating art — and it has always helped me to limit my symptoms. The process of creating art has also alleviated much of my social anxiety — a phenomenon that is backed by research. Early on in my mental health journey, I remember that I first found relief in art therapy groups. Even on my darker days, art provided a bright spot.Now, I try to work art projects into my self-care routine. I schedule at least an hour each week for creating. My work doesn’t have to be perfect — no painting ever is. It simply needs to fill me with joy, excitement and gratitude.Since receiving my first diagnosis, I have made leaps and bounds in my self-awareness and recovery. The people I have met, and the changes I have made to my life, have allowed me to be a more caring, informed and well-rounded individual. Through therapy and self-care, I have become a person empowered to make her own choices in life.Cindy Tillory is a mental health advocate and peer support specialist in sunny, southern California.

      "body": "I arrived at the psychiatric hospital in June of 2019. I had struggled for years with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder, and they both worsened after having my two kids. Leading up to the hospitalization, I had been abusing my anxiety medication (a benzodiazepine) and struggling with compulsive behaviors, like shopping, cutting and binge eating.That first day, I wore a long, blue and white dress with a sash around my waist, which was dressy for me. I was hopeful. I figured I would be there for just a couple of weeks, and then I would be cured. Maybe that’s how hospitalization works for some people, but it did not go that way for me. And for many people living with serious mental illness (SMI), the journey to recovery is not that simple.Looking back on my history, I hope to share the lessons I learned along the way.That morning, after kissing my husband goodbye, a member of the hospital staff took the sash from my dress. I was not allowed any item that could be used for self-harm. I was taken to my room, which looked like a dorm room, but there was no shower door, just a curtain (also a safety precaution). During the day, a staff member would come by and check on us every 15 minutes. At night, too. These extreme measures opened my eyes to how dire my situation was.My work to create an effective and sustainable treatment plan — one that would carry me through my outpatient healing — began immediately. I was given a busy schedule of classes on how to cope with difficult emotions, how to communicate about my illnesses and how to be mindful. When I didn’t have class, I met with a team of doctors and staff — social workers, therapists, a psychologist and psychiatrist. They told me I could not be discharged until we finished and approved my treatment plan. I also did a battery of psychiatric tests, growing my list of diagnoses: dysthymia, avoidant personality disorder, along with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder.After doctors determined I had treatment-resistant depression (meaning that some medications would not work for me) we opted to try electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). That also was a big wake-up call: I was very sick. That’s when I first understood that I would be walking a tight rope when it came to my recovery. I couldn’t be cured, but I could manage my symptoms and find my balance.After six weeks in treatment, I felt like I’d made significant progress and was ready to head home to see my family. But looking back, I wish I had stayed at the hospital longer, soaking up all the classes and advice I could.When I left inpatient treatment, doctors recommended that I continue ECT treatments, go to weekly therapy and refer to my treatment plan, which outlined ways to cope at home.At first, I relied heavily on ECT to work its “magic.” I would take my medication and go to therapy, but any sign of a bad mood left me wanting more ECT. I was going for a treatment every four to six weeks in a city two hours away. Eventually, I learned that even ECT can’t fix everything. My therapist once told me that I couldn’t get ECT every time I had a bad day. And she was right. I had to do the work, and it was hard. I struggled to sit with uncomfortable emotions.I still turned to my binge eating and compulsive shopping for comfort, racking up thousands of dollars on my credit card each month. I didn’t mean to, but this was a behavior that had served me in the past. I needed to learn how to acknowledge my feelings and tolerate distress in a healthy way.That’s one thing I’ve learned about recovery: It’s all a balancing act. And, as my compulsive behaviors spiraled, I didn’t know if my family could take another fall. Or if there would even be a net to catch me this time.I often feel resentful of my own brain; it seems like a betrayal that I have to walk the line so carefully when others don’t. And sometimes, I wonder if I I’ll ever go a day without thinking about my mental health. Even four years after my hospital stay, my recovery is a constant effort. I’m still learning that not all coping mechanisms are healthy and that slip ups and setbacks are common. I’m learning that medication can fail and even if I follow all the “rules,” I can still find myself in a depressive episode.However, I find comfort in knowing I am not alone. In 2020, an estimated 14.2 million adults in the U.S. dealt with a serious mental illness, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). And many of us who make up this statistic find the right kind of help and successfully manage our symptoms.When I get discouraged about my mental health, I like to think about the progress I’ve made — I’m miles away from where I was that day in my blue and white dress.For a long time, I blamed myself for my illness, and I shouldered the heavy burden of other people’s opinions about me and my mental health. However, through treatment and reflection, I have come to understand that my illness is not my fault.Reaching this realization has allowed me to find my voice. After I left the hospital, I started blogging about my experience. I told the truth about everything (suicidal thoughts, diagnoses, etc.). I told readers my deepest darkest secrets, and it was so freeing. I no longer feel shame or any stigma associated with having a mental illness. So many people have reached out to me since 2019, saying they feel the same way but can’t talk about it with loved ones yet. I get that, and I’m happy to lend my voice to others’ struggles if it means they don’t feel so alone, like I did years ago.Even with all this progress, it’s still hard — and that’s ok. Every day I get a little stronger, and I grow. That’s all I can ask of myself.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

I envisioned Hallmark-style Mother’s Days filled with cards, flowers and breakfast in bed. But over the years, that dream vanished. And one Mother’s Day, I found myself in the hospital’s psychiatric unit, praying my 17-year-old son, Nick, would live. He thought the solution to his pain was making an attempt on his life, and I was heartbroken.Before this incident, my attention had been on my 15-year-old daughter, Katie, who has a reactive attachment disorder, autism, bipolar disorder and several other diagnoses. These issues required much of my time and energy, and her problems were multilayered. Doctors disagreed on the diagnosis, and we didn’t receive the necessary social-emotional support from the school system. Ultimately, I didn’t really care about the cause of Katie’s struggles; I just longed for a solution that would allow her to live peacefully and independently, without being placed on frequent psychiatric holds.With Nick, I never saw it coming. I was barely keeping my head above water in dealing with Katie’s issues. When he was withdrawn and irritable, I chalked it up to teenage angst and never considered my handsome surfer son, with all the potential in the world, needed help. Nothing could describe my brokenness as I realized that not just one, but both children were struggling with their mental health.As a perfectionist, I beat myself up for not knowing. The signs of depression and anxiety didn’t appear in “What to Expect When Your Expecting” or the other parenting books I read in my attempt to raise my children. No one in my family suffered from mental health issues, and I didn’t hear any conversation about it in the parenting or school community.In the months before Nick’s suicide attempt, our relationship had deteriorated. He’d said I was a bad mother; evidently, I had never loved and cared for him. I was selfish and self-centered. I lived in a world of white picket fences where everything had to be perfect. So, on that Mother’s Day, while I sat by my son’s hospital bed, I wished I could resign. The position of mother had become a badge of shame.I came to realize something painful. Over the years, I had done an excellent job of maintaining a perfect façade. On the outside, things looked good. I was professionally accomplished. My house was clean and organized. My kids were bathed and fed. And I didn’t look like a mess. But I was a complete disaster on the inside. My marriage had deteriorated, my daughter had severe issues and my son had just attempted suicide. The façade shattered — but ultimately, that was a blessing. In the rebuilding of my life, I learned a few lessons:Over the years, I sought therapy, which provided some relief. But I never knew where to turn for peer support. Few people understood what I was going through with my daughter because she was so unique, as she navigated her emotions surrounding her diagnoses and her adoption. She didn’t fit neatly into most support group categories, and few people, even medical professionals, understood reactive attachment disorder.Eventually, I found a weekly support group for parents of teens through our mental wellness center. It was a lifesaver to share my unpredictable and imperfect life in a safe place without judgment. Years later, I learned about NAMI’s Family-to-Family course and the amazing resources available to parents and loved ones.One thing I was surprised to learn was that managing mental illness is like dealing with any other medical condition: it is part art and part science. Having been a type 1 diabetic since the age of 10, I am intimately familiar with the need to constantly monitor multiple factors for a successful day. I can do everything perfectly and my body can decide not to cooperate — causing my blood sugars to skyrocket or plummet — both of which are dangerous.When mental illness first showed up in our family, I thought that by taking a pill, everything would go back to “normal.” But I was wrong. While medication has its place — working for one person but not another — there are so many other factors that contribute to having a good day.For example, both my children do better when they eat well, exercise, don’t isolate and get enough sleep (but not too much). My daughter does better with medication, and my son does not. But there isn’t a perfect formula for either of their well-being, just like there isn’t for my diabetes. And this was something I had to experience to understand.Recognizing that I couldn’t resign from motherhood, I opened myself up to taking a different approach. I learned to be nicer to myself and to stop the negative self-talk. I examined my role in our family to understand how to do better in the future, and I educated myself on mental health — both mine and my kids. And I’m so grateful I did.Through self-care, therapy, journaling, prayer, support groups and 12-step recovery meetings, I went from surviving to thriving. I grew and found healing. If I hadn’t gone through those traumatic experiences, I wouldn’t be the person I am today, which sounds so simplistic. But the message is important: If my life had gone according to my script, I wouldn’t have this wonderfully imperfect life, living with joy despite the hardships.Valerie Cantella is passionate about helping others who have a loved one with mental health and substance abuse issues.

      "body": "In the 20 years I have lived with mental illness, I have learned some critical lessons — mostly the hard way.As I reflect on my past, I want to share what I have learned to help people like me reach recovery (hopefully, more easily and quickly than I did).Below are some key lessons. I wish I had known them much earlier on in my journey.My recovery required me to have compassion for myself. Indeed, my healing was rooted in the following principles:With these in mind, you can better practice self-care and forgiveness.Being diagnosed with a mental health condition or experiencing severe symptoms of a mental illness can feel all-consuming. But you will always be more than a diagnosis or a label.As you navigate a diagnosis and treatment, please remember the following:There is no cure for mental health conditions, particularly serious mental illness (SMI), but you can manage symptoms, and you can live a fulfilling life — the key is to get help early. Delaying treatment can make a condition worse and harder to treat, so it’s essential not to diminish or dismiss symptoms, or assume they’ll eventually go away.Empower yourself by learning about your illness and treatment options from reputable sources (practitioners, academic research, NAMI, etc.). Spend time researching and finding a good psychiatrist with experience treating your condition. Then, work with them to come up with a plan that works for you and your diagnosis. Be an active participant in your care and have open discussions with your provider about any concerns (side effects, for example).Be patient and keep in mind that treatment can take time to work. Do not change medication dosages on your own if you feel a medication is not working, as that can lead to relapse.Don’t fear, but be prepared for, a crisis. If you have a plan in place, you will have more control in the event of a mental health crisis. Ultimately, treatment can be a difficult process, but knowledge and self-awareness can help carry you though to recovery.Recovery can often feel like an unreachable place but remembering the following principles can give you strength.While it can be difficult to shift your perspective, doing so can create more opportunities for recovery.When living with mental illness, relationships and social connections can be difficult to forge and maintain. But the following lessons have allowed me to have healthy and supportive relationships:Healing requires acknowledging and surviving the stigma surrounding mental illness. Stigma is ignorance. It is the problem of those who perpetuate it, not yours. You don’t have to internalize it. There are too many tragedies in our community due to stigma, but there are also beautiful stories of recovery and progress, too. If you feel comfortable, speaking out against stigma will pave the way for self-empowerment and for others to find recovery.Over the course of your mental health journey, there will always be more to learn. But embrace what you have learned; chances are, you recognized many of these lessons in your own journey. But living by them is a conscious choice, every day. Prioritizing these steps can allow for huge strides in recovery. Perhaps you can even reach recovery more easily than I did.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "Living with any chronic illness isn’t easy, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is no exception.Some days, my thought patterns are easy to manage, and some days, the OCD wins — hands down. Indeed, my low points have included two major crises where I had to take significant time off work because I was so ill. But the high points include learning self-care, impermanence and resilience, and gaining an amazing community.I’ve had OCD for 27 years. That’s more than a quarter of a century. I figure passing 25 years makes this a good a time to look back at how my mental health journey started and what I’ve gained along the way.I first showed signs of OCD in middle school, though neither my family nor I realized it. I went through a period where I washed my hands all. the. time. I washed them so much that they were dry, cracked, raw and bleeding. I didn’t know why I was doing this, but I couldn’t stop. I was ashamed and didn’t talk to anyone about it because I was so embarrassed.Toward the end of high school, I developed “checking rituals.” Before going to bed every night, I had to make sure all the doors and windows were locked; otherwise, I believed, someone might break in and hurt my family. I also had to ensure that everything was plugged in properly; otherwise the house might catch fire while we were asleep. In my mind, the consequences of not checking were deadly, so I’d check the locks and plugs two, three, four, five times — as many times as it took before I could finally convince my brain we were safe. It was exhausting.It wasn’t until my junior year of college that I went from having some symptoms to full-blown OCD.I was moving into my dorm room, which had a shared bathroom, and the shower didn’t drain. I bought some Drano, poured it down the drain and thought, “There! Problem solved.” Later, my suitemate told me that she had contacted the maintenance department, who used another drain cleaner and told us it was very important not to use anything else. I started panicking.What if the two drain cleaners mix? I wondered. They can produce harmful gases. And the gases might be odorless. My room could be filling up with deadly odorless gas and I wouldn’t even know.I emailed maintenance, and they emailed back, telling me not to worry, that it would be ok. But their reassurance didn’t help. While I knew, logically, that the experts were right, I was still terrified, but didn’t know what else to do. I climbed into bed that night truly believing that I wasn’t going to wake up in the morning.I had more and more incidents over the next four months, and I became increasingly anxious and exhausted. By the end of that semester, I was so anxious I literally couldn’t sit still or focus on studying for my exams.You need to study for your exam tomorrow? I would tell myself. That’s nice. How about you take the bus to the store to buy cleaning products you don’t need because you can’t stop obsessing about the thing that might maybe potentially one day kill you if you don’t take care of it RIGHT NOW.Finally, with my roommate’s help, I went to the school counseling center, got my exams deferred and went home to start working on my mental health.As a young adult, I was a bit careless with my self-care. Stay up ‘til 2 am? Sure! Hydrate with Mountain Dew? Bring it on! I learned, though, that while these behaviors felt great in the moment, it felt even better when I adjusted my habits so that my OCD wasn’t completely overwhelming; over many years, I learned to set a regular bedtime, to remember to eat, to drink water, to take on less work, to take time to rest, and so forth. OCD forced me to develop habits that, ultimately, make a positive impact on all parts of my life.I also learned to change my relationship with OCD. While I certainly had (and have) every right to be frustrated and irritated when I’ve driven myself to exhaustion because I need to clean the whole house right now, being frustrated and irritated didn’t make me feel better any faster.Now, I’m much better (though definitely not perfect) at adopting the following perspective: “Ok, you don’t feel well and are frustrated. This isn’t permanent. What self-care can you do while you’re riding this out? What can you let go and pick back up when you’re well again?” Understanding impermanence and practicing this kind of resilience are incredibly helpful tools, so I’m glad having OCD gave me the opportunity to learn them.OCD is what led me to finding my community. I can’t tell you how wonderful it was the first time I attended a NAMI program in 2011. I didn’t have to explain myself, or my emotions, or what XYZ meant; everyone else in that room had been through similar experiences.It was in that first NAMI program, too, where I realized I’d learned a lot about mental health conditions and that I could help others. That first program was NAMI Family-to-Family, and I was able to connect as both a family member and share some perspective about having a mental health condition myself.I’m now trained as a NAMI Family-to-Family program leader, NAMI In Our Own Voice program leader, NAMI Ending the Silence program leader and NAMI Peer-to-Peer program leader and trainer. I’ve met amazing and wonderful people volunteering with NAMI over the years, and I am truly thankful that I can give back in this way. That feeling of coming home, of knowing that NAMI people are my people, is amazing every time.I’ve often wished I didn’t have OCD, particularly when I’ve been feeling low and struggling. That said, if I had the chance to re-do the last 27 years without OCD, I wouldn’t. I’m not defined by my OCD, but it has greatly influenced my life.OCD isn’t fun, but I wouldn’t be who I am without it, and I turned out to be pretty awesome. Weird, but awesome. I hope that 27 years down the line, I’ve continued to use my experiences with OCD — good and bad — to help me stay healthy, enjoy life and help the community I’m so glad to be part of.Liz Norton is the Director of Business Analysis at NAMI.Note: This article was originally published in the Spring 2022 Issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Schizoaffective disorder — a disorder that is a combination of schizophrenia and, in my case, major depression — is a big part of my life. I find that often, my symptoms dictate what I am able to do in my daily life. Fortunately, I have developed certain coping mechanisms that make the days easier and allow me to find some reprieve from my illness.My hope is that if you struggle with schizophrenia yourself, the following coping mechanisms might give you some relief from your illness as well.One of the best steps I have taken to improve my mental health is to get an emotional support animal, a cat named Fat Louie. Owning a cat has some strictly practical benefits; having a living creature around helps me understand whether the hallucinations I experience are real or not. If Fat Louie acts like he can see what I am seeing, then I know can know that it is real. And if he doesn’t, this can be a strong indicator that I am experiencing hallucinations.Equally importantly, he helps to comfort me when I am experiencing major depressive episodes. When I am struggling, I have the joy of experiencing complete and unlimited love. Without Louie, daily struggles would feel almost insurmountable. I fully understand that Fat Louie has been a lifesaver in helping me live a manageable life — and I hope animals can bring a similar comfort to others.This coping mechanism might come off as simplistic, but I’ve learned that even the smallest tasks can be lifesaving. I have a collection of different “fidget putties” and dough that help ground me when I am hallucinating. When I am hallucinating, I often feel like I am floating or that I am not completely in my body. But when I have some putty or dough to fidget with, I feel more securely rooted in my body, and I am able to stay present and grounded. Using putty and dough also help me when I am experiencing intense anxiety, as the use of my hands allows me to direct my energy toward a specific task.Like the putty and dough, having a heating pad helps when my hallucinations become irritating or debilitating. Often, my hallucinations — and resulting frustration — interrupt my ability to stay present and evaluate my reality. Heating pads (or warming stuffed animals) with lavender bring me a sense of comfort and stabilization that allow me to function on tough days.This coping mechanism, while seemingly contradictory to the coping mechanism above, can be just as helpful. When I am experiencing strong hallucinations and severe anxiety, almost nothing can relieve me from the distress; however, dunking my face in a bowl of cold water helps to “zap” me out of what I am experiencing. The introduction of an extreme temperature allows me to reset and pay attention to what is happening in my body. In times of severe distress, I typically need strong measures, and this particular coping mechanism has helped me on many occasions.I experience auditory hallucinations that cause me a lot of irritation and distress, but I have found that watching comforting shows or listening to music that I enjoy often helps to bring me some relief when I am having an episode. I also discovered that focusing on the plot of a show and the feeling of the music can help to drown out the voices and grounding me in reality.Schizophrenia is a severe — and often debilitating — mental illness, but I have discovered small actions that can aid me through many of my episodes. My hope is that learning more about my coping mechanisms will help people without a mental illness to understand schizophrenia from a lived experience perspective. But more importantly, I hope that my experience will provide people living with schizophrenia with tools to help them cope. Living with this illness can often be difficult, but there are ways to manage the symptoms and live a joyful life.Ashley Nestler, MSW is a survivor of multiple mental illnesses.

      "body": "I am the parent of an adult child with serious mental health challenges. Over the last decade, since the onset of symptoms and multiple failed attempts at an accurate “diagnosis,” our family has learned a lot about teamwork, self-care, support and acceptance — none of which we knew at the outset of our journey.This is what I’ve learned about family involvement in a loved one’s healing and recovery.1. Know Your Involvement Can Improve OutcomesAs a family member, you can be a reliable source to provide accurate family and clinical history to your loved one’s clinical team. Your hands-on experience is key to offering timely relevant clinical updates — you know your child, parent or sibling better than anyone else. In addition, you can play a vital role as an advocate within the applicable health and legal systems. Your loved one will benefit if you are able to “quarterback” the team, selecting and coordinating the labyrinth of available resources.2. Prepare for a Marathon, Not a SprintI was reminded early on by one of our clinicians to “prepare for a marathon; not a sprint.”Whenever things got tough, I would repeat the mantra “take the long view.” This has been invaluable because mental health recovery is not linear; it’s a roller coaster ride. But it has gotten easier with time. Learning to manage your energy levels around this emotionally and physically draining work requires a lot of self-care, especially given the fact that you are not in control of the timing of symptoms.I leaned into rituals and practices for my own well-being and aimed to nourish myself and replenish my own needs. I focused on gratitude, especially when things were going well. I have found it helpful to celebrate every victory along the way, skipping over nothing, no matter how small.Finally, it’s important to manage your financial resources accordingly by preserving as much capital as possible with each choice, as your expenses will likely be lifelong.3. Build a Village of SupportAt the outset, it’s important to begin building an “A” team of outpatient professionals who will be your “village.” These are people who will support you as well as your family member. You will benefit from multiple layers of support in more ways than you can imagine.As you build your team, note that not all care is equal. There is tremendous variability among quality and types of care depending on your personal resources, access to providers and the state and community where you live. Beware of internet marketing for treatment programs that claim they will solve all your problems. It’s not that simple. To pay for all this, you will need to become an expert at navigating the complex and frustrating maze of health insurance.Here’s a list of providers you will want to know about:4. Practice Radical AcceptanceOne of the most emotionally challenging, yet important, pieces is learning to reframe your expectations of what your child may have been to who your child is. You may witness your child going from a near-death experience to showing their unique and special purpose on the planet, and sometimes more than once.You may experience stages of grief as you navigate your loved one’s mental health journey, as you will likely experience what is known as an “ambiguous loss.” This occurs when the person is still alive in physical form, but not the person they used to be (this is also common with conditions like Alzheimer’s and dementia, among others).When you can meet them where they are, not where you had hoped they would be, it helps with both connection and hopefulness. I’ve learned that my own acceptance of “what is” is one of the most important parts of my happiness and of my relationship with my loved one. When I am in the present moment, focusing on where they are right now, not where I had perhaps hoped they would be, I am grateful.Enjoying my connection with them and appreciating their gifts and insights brings me hope.5. Surround Yourself with Supportive and Empathetic FriendsYour life experiences may be radically different from those of most of your friends. As such, you may notice that friendships change; some old ones will go, and new ones will enter. It’s helpful appreciate how difficult it may be for your old friends to understand how different your experience is from theirs.My own experience is that some people become so uncomfortable that they stop asking about your family member, so as not to “upset you,” not understanding that it’s actually they who are upset, and you who would appreciate the listening ear!It's important to set healthy boundaries to preserve your capacity around friends. Become masterful at saying “no.” Avoid over-committing, even if it felt good at one point in your life, as things are different now. Finally, I recommend reducing social media exposure as it can feel triggering to see what others are posting when you and your loved ones are struggling.6. Remain person-centricYour loved one needs to learn through trial and error how to manage their own mental health as this is the only thing that will be sustainable in the long run. To assist, it’s important for you to use recovery-oriented language, such as “mental or behavioral health” challenge vs. “mental illness.” Practice reframing your thinking from the model of “illness” to “different or non-neurotypical thinking,” so as to remove judgement, help decrease stigma and to expand possibilities for you and for them.7. Be Open to Exploring Outside the Standard Medical ModelMy own bias was that the model of “medication first” was the only approach to stabilize severe symptoms. And medication is important. However, in the longer term, people with mental health challenges will benefit immensely from a comprehensive system of well-being, including: trusting relationships with family and a close circle of friends; an experienced therapist and psychiatrist; proper nutrition for their physical constitution; regular exercise; and meditation, breathing exercises and other calming, restorative practices.Finally, I invite you to trust the process of life — the right people and possibilities will show up when needed.

      "body": "I have bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that has shaped my career, my relationships and even my sense of self. Yet, until recently, I treated this part of my life as a shameful secret to be hidden at all costs. The negative stereotypes surrounding bipolar disorder, combined with some hurtful personal experiences when sharing my experience, made me terrified to reveal my diagnosis. Even many close friends and family members did not know.What I later realized, however, was the cost of keeping this secret. By hiding my diagnosis, I was placing a heavy burden on myself — depriving myself of the chance to be in control of my personal story — one that I eventually decided to lift. I would be lying if I said that sharing my diagnosis is never awkward or frightening, but this is only half the picture. What I never expected was how empowering sharing my diagnosis would be.Last October, I faced a difficult turning point in my mental health journey. I had a manic episode, and during the height of mania, I sent nonsensical emails to my graduate student peers. I often suffer memory loss during episodes, but I know that the emails focused on “magic spells” and a belief that someone was trying to hurt me.Some of my peers found my emails frightening and expressed concern for their personal safety. When I heard this, I was dumbstruck. Even amid my mania, I was shocked to realize that people might be afraid of me. To be clear, I blame negative media portrayals of mental illness and not my peers for this reaction. As a psychologist, I know that humans make inferences about the world based on what we see. And what we see in books, movies, and TV shows is mental illness paired with violence and chaos.When the episode was over, I made the decision to stop hiding. My peers’ reaction helped me see that people need exposure to mental illness. People are often afraid of things they do not understand. I wanted to facilitate change by educating my peers. Additionally, I realized that telling my story allows me to control the narrative, rather than allowing gossip and secondhand information to take shape.So, I wrote an email to my peers explaining that I have bipolar disorder and included educational information on psychosis. Hitting “send” on that email was excruciating, but luckily, my peers responded positively. One even thanked me. Although I wish this incident had not taken place at all, I am grateful for the personal growth it inspired. Since then, I have become more open about my mental health and have even sought out opportunities to share my experiences with others.The more I tell my story, the more I realize that disclosing one’s mental illness is an art, not a science. “Coming out” is a never-ending process, not a one-time grand event. I’ve learned that you do not have to tell everything to everyone. For example, I can disclose my diagnosis but keep private details, such as the medications I take and my medical history, to myself. Or I might share intimate details with one person and the bare minimum with another. Realizing I could make these distinctions has been liberating and made the disclosure process easier. Now, when symptoms arise, it feels incredibly freeing to simply tell the truth rather than make up yet another excuse for canceled plans or odd behavior.I don’t have all the answers, nor do I want to pressure anyone to talk about their mental health. But I strongly believe that mental illness will never be destigmatized until more people speak openly about it, and I want to lead by example. I have always loved the words of Marianne Williamson: “And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.”When we share our stories, we inadvertently give others permission to do the same. Uttering the words, “I have a mental illness,” brings to light something that was previously shrouded in secrecy and darkness, and that is a powerful act.Ashley Ransom completed her Ph.D. in developmental psychology at Cornell University and is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

      "body": "When considering different types of treatment for mental health, therapy may be the option that first comes to mind. As the national conversation about mental health has evolved, pursuing therapy has become more and more common — and people are challenging the stigma that surrounds seeking treatment. Indeed, it often seems as though most people have been in therapy at some point in their lives. When making a decision about mental health treatment, it’s important to know that there are different types of therapy to try.Looking back, I wish I had known about two specific types of therapy: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT).CBT, as defined by the Mayo clinic, is a type of talk therapy that “helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking, so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.” In simpler terms, CBT is a form of therapy that helps a person reframe their thoughts brought on by mental illness.As someone who has been in therapy since I was nine years old, I have encountered many different therapeutic techniques, and CBT has worked wonders for me. I was able to use CBT’s three main practices — thought-reframing, acknowledgement/awareness and relaxation/meditation — to navigate my negative thoughts in the throes of depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), bipolar disorder and more. This method allowed me to sit down and verbalize the issues I was struggling with, which made them feel more “real.” This, in turn, made my negative thoughts easier to tackle. If you’re interested in pursuing CBT, it’s important to learn about its core components.Even though this may take time, thought reframing can be one of the most effective tactics in CBT. For example, if you feel like you are losing control of something in your life, thought reframing would require you to evaluate the situation, determine what you do have control of in your life and focus on taking the necessary steps to address the thing you can control. This technique does take practice but can be very beneficial once mastered. In my experience using this technique, I have been able to look at a specific struggle, such as a fear of abandonment, and remind myself of the people who have been there for me and what positivity they bring to my life.Perhaps when you hear the phrase “acknowledging your feelings,” you may think of “throwing a pity party.” This technique is, in fact, the opposite. Becoming aware and recognizing what you’re feeling are critical steps in overcoming counterproductive thinking. Without fully identifying what you’re feeling, there’s no way to pinpoint what you should be doing to counteract them. For example, when something makes me angry, I don’t tell myself I’m being irrational for feeling that way. Instead, I let myself momentarily feel angry before taking positive steps to combat negative actions that may pop up from that feeling.When you think of meditation, perhaps you picture deep breathing exercises. Although that is an important piece of meditation practice, breathing is not the only technique to practice. Relaxation and meditation can consist of other practices like sensory focus, mind cleansing and cognitive introspection.Sensory focus may be one of the quickest ways to ground yourself. If you’re feeling yourself get to a negative place, looking around you and listing the things you see or hear can bring you back to a more positive headspace. This has been the most helpful tactic for me when I’m in public and start to get overwhelmed. Mind cleansing requires you to let go of negative thoughts that you may hear on repeat in your brain. Cognitive introspection is reflecting on the coping mechanisms you use to handle (or avoid) a situation. Although this technique may be challenging and uncomfortable, identifying negative behaviors and reactions may be exactly what you need to move forward in a more positive way.DBT, a skills-based therapy technique, helps people tolerate and regulate their emotions. It is based on cognitive behavioral principles and focuses on “problem solving and acceptance.”As defined, DBT is under the “umbrella” of CBT, but it works more with problem-solving than thought reframing. Because DBT is driven by problem-solving, many of the activities done in this type of counseling are more physically hands-on than CBT. I also used DBT in therapy sessions throughout the years which helped tremendously with dealing with my bipolar swings. Having more hands-on techniques to practice has given me things to do instead of living in a negative headspace during my mania and depression.Typical DBT activities and tactics may include the following:Just about any therapist or counselor can vouch for the importance of writing down your thoughts and feelings. However, that’s not the only way to journal when it comes to DBT. Making lists, releasing thoughts without fear of judgment and writing down personal goals are all ways to journal effectively. If you’re new to therapy or are seeing someone new, it can be especially hard to fully express your feelings out loud.In writing these things down in a journal, you’re still getting those feelings out in a way that is personal to just you. From there, reading your journal to a counselor may be a good transition into being more candid with your feelings.To practice tolerating negative feelings, DBT often encourages using worksheets (many of which are available online) to walk you through the process. You’ll find many practices including opposite emotion thinking, distress tolerance, emotion regulation practices, personal reflections and more.Opposite emotion thinking is using radically opposite thought processes. For example, if you’re feeling like you need to isolate yourself, go out and do something to get out of the house. Distress tolerance has to do with your reaction to a stressful or distressing situation. A practical way to put that into practice would be to cool yourself down if you feel yourself get physically warm from a triggering situation. In doing that, you’re handling your future reactions by dealing with your current emotional needs. For emotion regulation, a mental check-in can be a beneficial practice to quickly get in touch with what you’re feeling. This can also be done for personal reflections, as well. Most often, these types of practices are done in a group therapy setting, but you can also do them by yourself.Using your senses for your mental health recovery can be extremely effective. Taking note of what you’re sensing can help you achieve more personal awareness and help with grounding techniques, which are most commonly used for anxiety. Using your senses — sight, sound, smell, taste and touch — keeps your focus on what’s physically around you at that moment, not what’s going on in your brain. Sensory practices can be done anywhere and anytime, making it one of the easiest things to do if you can’t access other DBT things. These techniques can also apply to mindfulness in the way that individuals are able to be more aware of thoughts, feelings and surroundings to help ground emotions.Of course, CBT and DBT are not the only types of therapy out there — and they aren’t cure-alls for every mental illness. Also, therapy isn’t the only thing that helps in your mental health recovery (medication and peer support, among other things, are helpful). However, by incorporating therapy into your recovery journey, you might that you make strides toward healthier thinking and emotional well-being.Emmie Pombo is an author, beauty writer and mental health advocate from Nashville, TN.

      "body": "Taking an antipsychotic medication can be a painful and difficult decision, mostly because of the stigma surrounding serious mental illness (SMI), psychosis and the medications themselves. When I first began taking an antipsychotic, I struggled to accept my situation. Ultimately, the fear of taking a stigmatized drug impacted my course of treatment and overall health outcome. I fell into powerful traps and pitfalls that are common among patients with SMI who take antipsychotic medications.I wish I had known then what I understand now. So, let’s debunk these common myths that hinder treatment and positive health outcomes.As I began my journey with treatment, I believed that not taking an antipsychotic meant that I didn’t actually have a mental illness. In other words, I am only sick if I take this medicine. The truth is, refusing to take the medicine obviously will not make the symptoms of any illness go away.We don’t think this way about medications for any other illnesses. For example, when you have heart disease, you would never reason that, “If I don’t take this heart medicine, then I don’t have heart disease,” because, obviously, that doesn’t make sense. In fact, this line of thinking would be life-threatening.Yet, many of us who could benefit from taking antipsychotic medication resist our treatment plans; after all, stigma tells us that we can “fix” ourselves on our own terms. And if we can fix ourselves without antipsychotics, then there was nothing really wrong or flawed about us after all.When I was first prescribed medication, I thought my life (particularly my social and professional life) would be over if I took an antipsychotic. I complied with treatment for many years, but I was hard on myself and lived in fear of anyone finding out about my “big secret.” I constantly judged myself for taking such a powerful medication, and I ended up going off of it prematurely solely due to self-stigma. This, naturally, led to an avoidable relapse.I also firmly believed taking an antipsychotic would keep me from being in a romantic relationship; I worried that I would face rejection as soon as anyone found out about my medication.I knew how my treatment might be perceived; the pervasive stigma made antipsychotics sound like a threat or a judgment, rather than a positive, lifesaving answer. But the reality is that I could not start that a relationship until I took an antipsychotic and prioritized my treatment.The medication saved my life and, in fact, provided a foundation for the future and the relationship I had always wanted. While disclosing my history and medication regimen to my partner was scary, it ended up being an important and necessary passage to build a trusting and supportive relationship.What I now know, in hindsight, is this: my life is only over if I don’t take an antipsychotic.Receiving a stigmatized diagnosis can be intimidating and painful — I’ve been there. Receiving a diagnosis like schizophrenia can feel isolating. So, naturally, many people hope to avoid receiving the label at all. I, like many people, avoided treatment because I wanted to avoid facing the issue altogether; accepting treatment means acknowledging an illness and preparing to weather the social stigma.I know that some people hesitate to see a psychiatrist because taking an antipsychotic medication seems like just one more step toward social condemnation. The fact is, you can’t change your reality by refusing to address it. If you suffer from heart disease and have a heart attack, you would immediately seek medication to prevent another crisis. Psychosis is no different than a physical ailment — the only way forward is to treat the symptoms.The inaccurate and unhealthy messages we receive about mental illness change our perception of treatment. Accordingly, many of us see an antipsychotic as something more than a medicine for medical condition — it is a confirmation or proof that there is something wrong with us as human beings. We have internalized stigma to the point that we believe that needing this form of treatment is a moral failing.The stigma also changes the perceptions of others; people often receive the message that they should be wary of anyone taking an antipsychotic; they may be unreliable and even dangerous. Because some people believe that taking an antipsychotic is proof of a “red flag,” it is easy to view your illness through the perception of others.Only when you choose to look at your illness through your own perspective and sense of compassion for yourself can you act logically, making decisions based on what you know is right for you.I have been stable for a decade while taking a maintenance dose of an antipsychotic each day. In this decade, I have gotten married, have had a child, have developed a career and thrived. The truth is that the rest of my life could not begin until I accepted and consistently took my antipsychotic medication. And I learned what works best for me — I will be taking this medication indefinitely.My medicine is no longer a secret to the people in my life, and now, taking an antipsychotic is no different than taking my contacts out every night. It is my safety net to ensure that I don’t have to suffer through psychosis again, and I will just continue to move forward in my life with this wonderful existence I have cultivated for myself. I once chose to see my illness through other people’s perceptions instead of my own. But now I know better.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "I am not “normal,” although, at one time, I wished for nothing more. At 50 years of age, I am currently a grossly under-employed husband and father, proudly watching my two sons surpass me. The reasons for my current situation are plentiful, but at the root is my path through mental illness — and a continuing evolution toward recovery. I like to joke that I am a diagnostic alphabet soup: ADHD, PTSD, depression, anxiety. Take your pick, I have them all.Since first seeking professional therapy in my adolescence, my journey has prioritized being “normal,” rather than having open and honest conversations that could have helped me find healing. I’ve only recently considered that normal should never have been my focus. I believe that normal is a subjective cultural and generational concept, bolstering the stigma surrounding mental illness.My mental health journey began in my pre-teen years when I was unaware of my deep-seated depression. I lived in the Appalachian Mountains with my mother and older brother after we all escaped from a violently abusive household. This was a time when my father could mask his bipolar disorder with an 80-hour work week and substance abuse. No one questioned the physical or emotional abuse he doled out, as this was a “normal” response for a man under financial stress at the time.I was a “latch-key kid” in the 1980s. For me, this meant essentially living alone in a house of four. When my ADHD reared its ugly head in the eighth grade, my teachers decided that it would be easier to hide me away in “in-school suspension” (ISS) — a six-by-eight-foot closet housing six desks and a one-way mirror for the teacher to observe us. If I wasn’t in ISS, I was in one-on-one counseling during school hours. But these sessions did not acknowledge the root of my challenges or even my potential for growth — they simply existed in an effort to mold me into something normal. Because I could never achieve this goal, I was quietly labeled as “mentally deficient.”I never took algebra; I took consumer math. I never took foreign languages or extra credit; I took summer school and received psychiatric intervention. This insufficient education and the decision to write me off as “deficient” were viewed as perfectly fine courses of action — just another step in the direction of normal.After high school and a move to Michigan, I quickly adapted to a life of substance abuse, developing an addiction to anything in reach. People around me failed to see this as another manifestation of my illness — it was seen as a normal way of acting out, done at the “appropriate” time — in my 20s. 30 years later, I look back and take note of how much I justified my substance use under the guise of it being seen as normal at the time.I finally realized that spending decades of my life trying to be normal wasn’t serving me. My struggles — and the insufficient response by the institutions that wrote me off instead of addressing my illness — continued to impact my well-being. Now that I have the gift of hindsight and perspective, I can see how normal got me where I am today; a place where I am still figuring out how to address my needs and access appropriate care. When I hear someone ask me, “Why can’t you just be normal for a change?” I hear someone who wants me to fit into a small box that eases their discomfort, like my teachers did in school.I cannot, and no longer seek to, control other people’s definitions of normal, as these socially-constructed perceptions only perpetuate stigma around mental health issues and make it harder for people to recover. Now I know that normal doesn’t matter; instead, I focus on healthy. The concept of achieving a state of healthy living provides two distinct advantages: It is self-defined, and it allows for specific and achievable goals. Healthy considers the reality of the situation (no matter how uncomfortable) and allows me to tailor my care to my needs.Achieving health is dictated through my choices and goals, no one else’s. It is an acute awareness of my mental and physical thresholds — and a deep respect for them. Healthy is not about how I react to you, but rather how I acknowledge myself as someone who can achieve more than normal.Erik A. Magnuson is father and husband living in Central Florida.

The majority are “Baby Boomers,” a generation at high risk of suicide (and a generation that will carry this risk as they advance in years).More than 1 in 9 U.S. adults aged 65 and older experienced a mental illness in 2020. Yet, the mental health system poses significant barriers to care for older adults: there is a severe shortage of geriatric psychiatrists, and psychiatrists overall are more likely than other specialty providers to “opt out” of Medicare – the program that provides health insurance to nearly all Americans over age 65. Additionally, available mental health services are under-used by this demographic. This unquestionably heightens the role of mental illness as a strong risk factor for suicide in older adults.Ageism is another risk factor for suicide — it promotes the belief that depression is a normal part of aging, that older adults are preoccupied with increasing levels of illness, and that they may come to see suicide as an escape.Older adult suicides will rise as this population grows. However, younger age groups receive most suicide prevention attention. To change the broadening mental health conversation, advocacy groups, individuals and practitioners alike should embrace anti-ageism and anti-stigma efforts.Making these changes requires a deeper understanding of the current landscape and the impact of ageism.In 2020, men aged 65-74 had a suicide rate of 24.7/100,000, and men aged 75 and older had a rate of 40.5/100,000 – both higher than the overall national rate of 13.5/100,000. Notably, older adult suicide is predominantly a male phenomenon; the suicide rate of women aged 65-74 in 2020 was 5.6/100,000, and the rate among women aged 75 and older was 3.9/100,000.Older men at highest risk of suicide may:To address ageism, we first need to define it. Ageism is stigma directed toward aging and the aged. It consists of negative or patronizing attitudes, stereotypes and beliefs resulting in prejudicial or discriminatory treatment of older persons. In a national survey, 82% of older adults aged 50-80 reported experiencing some form of ageism in their everyday lives. While ageism is a common occurrence, it is a form of prejudice that is less likely to be recognized.Ageism makes the symptoms of depression and anxiety worse, increases stress and negatively affects overall mental health; and the impact on depression is particularly high in men.Studies show that ageism raises suicide risk by weakening protective factors, such as self-esteem, self-efficacy and hopefulness. This, in turn, may make someone feel like a burden or make them feel disconnected from their support system. These factors can lead to suicidal ideation and suicidal intent.Self-stigma may be the most harmful consequence of ageism. Internalizing the stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice often produces a negative self-assessment. Older people (particularly men) may come to believe that their life has no value, meaning or purpose — and that ending it would relieve others of the “burden.”Grassroots organizations and local mental health centers are a powerful counter to the stigma surrounding mental illness. They have a unique opportunity to raise awareness of how ageism stigmatizes older populations, makes them less likely to use mental health services and contributes to suicide risk in a high-risk group.As for practitioners, mental health providers must support geropsychiatric care, which is often in short supply in many communities. Accordingly, suicide prevention programs must put older men on the agenda at the county and state levels and implement suicide prevention programming aimed at older men.Additionally, the implementation of 988 as a national crisis line is an opportunity to reach more vulnerable populations. However, call center staff must be sensitive to the effects of ageism and know the risk factors and warning signs of suicide in older men.As Suicide Prevention Awareness Month ends, it’s important to think to the future, and how we can make changes every other month of the year. Hopefully, that will start with acknowledging and addressing this high-risk group.Tony Salvatore directs suicide prevention at Montgomery County Emergency Service, a nonprofit psychiatric hospital and crisis center in Norristown, PA.

My son’s story began well before the fateful night of Dec. 5, 2017, but it was this night that changed everything.My son, Tyler, found himself isolated, living in his car and feeling suicidal. After consuming lethal levels of alcohol and other drugs, he reached out to me for help, expressing his suicidal thoughts.Even though I am a physician assistant who occasionally handles mental health and substance abuse cases, I was completely lost when it came to my son being the one who needed help. His texts and calls were ambiguous, and I was confused by what he was telling me. Was he really contemplating suicide? Was this really happening?I contacted my mother, who lived near Tyler, and thankfully, she was able to locate him and his vehicle. On the other end of the phone, I could hear her exhale with relief. She opened the back-passenger car door, saw that Tyler was incoherent and crying, with an open wound on his forehead and made the decision to call emergency services.When the ambulance arrived, I asked to speak with the responders. I explained my level of experience and listed the psychiatric medications my son had recently taken. I also explained that I thought my son was having an uncharacteristic change in his mental status from a combination of his medication’s side effects and alcohol toxicity. I felt this could be contributing to his suicidal thoughts and behaviors — and asked that they provide that information to the attending physician or charge nurse in the emergency department.They said they would, but I don’t believe they did.When Tyler arrived at the hospital, disheveled and intoxicated, he was first treated as a disposable annoyance for the evening. Unfortunately, I didn’t find this surprising; in many cases, even trained professionals simply don’t know how to de-escalate a situation of this nature, so they often treat individuals with substance use disorder like criminals. That said, having a mental illness or substance abuse disorder does not equate to committing a crime. And being suicidal, in my son’s case, was a mental health crisis, not an unlawful act or a moral failing.When Tyler arrived at the medical center, he began begging the police officers to shoot him. He wanted to remove himself from the pain he couldn’t find a way to bear anymore. Tyler was put in restraints and given a sedative. After this, his ability to function with any control became impossible. The report states that, after waking up in a confused and scared state, realizing he had been tied down, Tyler started yelling and spitting. His medication-induced psychosis at that time was likely the reason, but there was no mention of this in the report.I don’t excuse my son’s actions, but I also don’t have the full story — and I know, based on his grandmother’s first-hand account of the situation, that the officer was irritated about having to “handle” an “addict.” Even though Tyler was under the influence, de-escalation should have been the tactic in this case, not verbal escalation from trained professionals with a suicidal patient.Some nurses later told me and my son that they expected difficult behavior in these situations and never take it personally. However, this officer did, and he charged my son with a felony.After my son’s psychiatric assessment, the social worker and board-certified physicians collectively determined that he needed immediate psychiatric care.Over the phone, the social worker told my husband and I that the officer would certainly take Tyler to a mental health treatment facility — and I had no reason to believe there was anywhere else he could possibly go.The next morning, after miraculously getting a flight into Texas, I assumed I would drive directly to the hospital to find my son there. Instead, I got a call from Tyler, who had been redirected to the county jail. He only had a minute to make his one call and inform me of his location.What began as both a physical and psychiatric emergency had turned into an incarceration and a felony. My mother, who had been at the hospital, told me that the deputy assigned to transfer Tyler was quite unhappy that he had to deal with another “drunk” in the middle of the night. He disregarded the directive to take my son to the psychiatric hospital and instead drove him to jail. He placed a bag over my son’s head and left his hospital gown gaping in the front leaving his naked body exposed.After arriving at the jail, my son sat on a bench for several hours in handcuffs, unable to cover himself and begged someone for some clothes. Eventually, he was put in a main cell with all the other unfortunate “criminals.”Within 24 hours, he would start the real process of withdrawal from alcohol. This is an incredibly dangerous experience — heart attacks, seizures and sudden death are all possibilities in alcohol withdrawal. And yet, at this critical point, my son was put into solitary confinement. He was held in a small cell with a urine and vomit-soaked mattress thrown on the floor near a gaping hole in the cement meant to be used as a toilet.He yelled out to find out what time it was periodically because the bright, fluorescent lights were never turned off, but nobody would answer him. He asked for water, but he was left thirsty. He was shaking uncontrollably in withdrawals, but it didn’t seem to matter. He was still suicidal, but that didn’t seem to be important to anyone.When I arrived in Austin, I drove directly to the jail. Tyler walked out in a jail issued jumpsuit, tears soaking his face. We sat down, looked at each other and bawled. I never thought I’d see my son in jail, but what was killing me in that moment was that just hours before, he had told me he wanted to end his life. I just kept thinking how scarring his experience must have been.After several additional years of self-destructive behavior, my son is healthy, happy and in recovery. I’m grateful to be able to say that now. But this is only after our family discovered that Tyler had experienced severe trauma as a teenager and grappled with the compounding effects of trauma from his treatment that night in hospital. We have been able to get him extensive counseling and treatment, and he is in a much better place in his life.But this happy conclusion could have been reached earlier. There is always more to the story — and I’ve always believed that if law enforcement or hospital staff had approached Tyler with empathy instead of annoyance, his healing could have begun sooner.After our traumatizing incident with law enforcement, I reached out to NAMI. They were the very first organization to actually listen to my story and give me guidance, resources and real help for my son. I am eternally thankful for their contributions at the time when we needed them most. They were the only ones who took the time, showed compassion and listened to my story when I just needed so desperately to be heard.Lisa M.

But, as the story goes, a friend helped them carry their belongings and that friend saved them from hurting themselves or ending their life.This story is quite inaccurate as it assumes an easy fix can solve a mental health problem, it misrepresents the severity of mental illness, and it minimizes the available resources that can help someone who is suffering from thoughts of suicide. Most notably, the story never addresses or resolves the reason for the student’s suicidal ideation — which was triggered by bullying in school. This is one of many possible journeys and only one of many outcomes. Mental health and people are much more complex.While that story does highlight the power of support, it does not reflect many people’s reality as they grapple with serious mental illness and suicidal ideation. The “savior culture” is a reductionist approach. It does not serve anyone who needs mental health support, nor does it allow for us to imagine the range of possibilities that in fact do exist for getting someone the help they need — based on what they are willing to access or what they have access to. Assuming the smallest of actions will “solve the problem” discounts the struggle of a person who suffers day in, day out, and it limits the options a loved one can take to offer help to someone with a serious mental illness.Major depression, for instance, does not necessarily look like this school-boy story; it’s more than one bad day, and it takes more than a kind gesture to tackle. And, even further, there are a range of lived experiences that fall under what major depression can look like for someone — so the level of severity is not fixed, just as there are no fixed solutions — this makes mental health professionals and various resources essential in the process.When I lost two dear people to suicide within a short time frame, my friend Mike and my cousin Lou, I started thinking about mental health more than ever before. I recalled the story about the student. I asked myself what I could have done to prevent their deaths. I recounted what I was doing during their final steps. The record played over countless times in my head as I thought about how they might have been here “if only” I had done something differently.What I’ve learned since then is this self-blame simply discounted every effort they made (and efforts also made by others) to try to address their mental health and reality every day. We need to stop that record from playing — it discounts the seriousness of the matter at hand and does not fully appreciate the struggle and pain that someone with mental illness is confronting and addressing every day.It also made me reflect on what I could do moving forward to raise awareness, to seek what resources are available and how we can better access and share them with others. I thought about how we might better understand people’s journeys with mental illness, and our own, as friends and family, who want to help them in the process.According to the CDC, suicide rates increased 30% between 2000-2018, with non-Hispanic American Indian or Alaskan Native men, and non-Hispanic white men, having some of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. Middle aged adults (aged 35-64) also fall among the most vulnerable groups. And although we know these trends — no one whose life ended by suicide is simply a statistic.So, how can we humanize who we are addressing and make sure that people have proper access to mental health care? How can we use what we know to change how we talk about mental health? How can changing the narrative impact the reality?Open dialogue is only helpful if we can share the truth. We can start talking about the reality of depression as it is, a legitimate medical condition that causes sadness, loss of interest and potentially feeling as if life is not worth living. It is a condition, not a weakness, that typically requires long-term mental health treatment.When it comes to “our role” in changing the reality on suicide and mental health, you can sign up and advocate for structural changes and greater support for mental health access.As for our own personal interactions with someone who needs or is seeking mental health assistance, here are some suggestions:If you or someone you know needs support, there are plenty of professional resources that would help you, including NAMI, SMI Advisor and others. The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health is also a wonderful resource that will help you see that you are not alone.I write this article in loving memory of my friend Michael J. “Mike” Malinowski and my cousin Lutfi “Lou” Mukhar. Each were beloved sons, brothers, friends, uncles, nephews, cousins and more. I could still hear Mike’s laughter echo in my ear even years after his departure from this earth. And I will never forget the way Lou would endearingly refer to me as “cousin.”Dr. Claudia Youakim is a sociologist and DEI expert who focuses on creating inclusive systems through evidence-based research and policy reform.

      "body": "Sending a child off to college is not easy for any parent. But when your child has mental illness, the process of letting go is even more difficult. The concerns I have as a parent are not unique; they are simply amplified by my daughter’s diagnoses. The stakes, given my family’s history, feel higher.While many families were celebrating Christmas in 2020, I was admitting Sheridan to the hospital because she was afraid she was going to harm herself. A year and a half later, Sheridan is getting ready to start her senior year of high school with her sights set on college. As she meets with her counselor to discuss the options, I am filled with a variety of emotions, namely excitement, pride and fear. A lot of fear.College students already grapple with a variety of challenges during their first year, and those with a history of depression, anxiety or bipolar disorder (or all three), like Sheridan, need extra support and a plan. For parents like me, this transition is not just about buying a cute duvet for the dorm.There are a significant number of parents in my position, given that approximately 41% of college students reported symptoms of depression last year and roughly 31% of all college students had already received an anxiety disorder diagnosis at some point in their lives. Additionally, 90% of counseling centers report an increased demand for mental health services. Clearly, my daughter is not alone.By talking about these issues with each other, and our children, we can help. I believe that when we discuss things, regardless of the situation, we build bridges that lead to solutions.It can be hard to initiate a conversation about mental health with a teenager — sometimes Sheridan doesn’t want to talk. At the same time, I am overwhelmed with fears that I want and need to talk about. I struggle with knowing when, how much and who to speak to. Sometimes I get it right and sometimes, I’m just not sure.The one time I got it right was last Christmas, which was the one-year anniversary of Sheridan being admitted to the hospital. Preemptively, I started talking to my kids. It was fruitful. My older daughter realized she had some triggers around Christmas and talked to her counselor about it. My other daughter did the same.As a family, we decided to keep the holiday as simple as possible. This wasn’t necessarily easy. I had to consciously work at saying no to invitations. We took it day by day, based on how we were feeling, andgot through it. I didn’t talk about it non-stop. Rather, I created the space where they could talk to me and let them know I was there for them. In doing so, we avoided additional triggers and stress.I’m also finding it helpful to respond rather than react — something that is easier said than done. “I think I want to go to a university in a city,” Sheridan said one morning.“ABSOLUTELY NOT!” shouted the voice in my head. The other voice said, “take a deep breath, Denise,” and “let’s get support.” I hired a college counselor and coach to help her think through the options.Yet, my fears remain.Recently, I was talking to a friend and realized that I could consult with Sheridan’s counselor about my fears and enlist her support. This reminded me that talking to trusted friends and family members often spark ideas I wouldn’t have thought of on my own. This is helpful because, in the absence of other perspectives, my mind (like many parents’) just makes lists of what could go wrong: Who will be there if she gets lost, loses her keys or something else goes wrong? What do I need to have in place to protect and support her? What do I need to do so I can be happy for her instead of worrying about her every second of the day?These may sound like normal maternal concerns, but when it comes to a child with mental illness, lost keys can become a crisis. Overwhelm can become life-threatening. This is not a fear; it’s a fact.I’d love to tell you that I have it all figured out. I’d love to leave you with a few solid takeaways, but this is what I know: it’s hard. I struggle with this every day. There is a lot I need to do to support Sheridan during this transition. There is a lot I need to do to support myself through this transition. And even though I know that I cannot fix Sheridan’s mental health challenges, I know that when I am resourced, I can show up as the parent I want to be and need to be. She deserves nothing less.Denise Mueller is senior executive in the biotech field. She is a mother of three beautiful daughters. Denise’s journey with mental health began as an adult when her mother became ill. Today, it’s a journey she shares with her daughter. Together, they continue to support each other to grow, learn and heal.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "When I finally got sober and started taking my prescribed medications correctly, I felt like I had a chance at life again. I was inspired by the 12-step programs and began to realize there was a mental health movement happening in my peer community — one that provided tools for recovery. I learned that, someday, I might even be able to work as a peer support specialist. So, as I began my recovery journey, I held onto that aspiration.I started off my job search with no real resumé, having worked less than a year in my entire life. I was turning 30, and I still had no idea how to communicate clearly or professionally. Sometimes, it felt like, “Uh…you wanna get some beer?” was about all I knew how to say. It took me some time to join the world around me and find meaningful passions and connections. I started volunteering places. I joined a project where we presented our recovery stories to other groups like nursing students and social work interns. I joined the community mental health board.As I took on these new tasks and challenges, I warmed up to the society I once rejected. The fact that I could create positive change made it worth it. My peers helped me see that there was a great life waiting for me. The community began to see my value — and I did, too.As I tackled the challenges in front of me and made strides in my recovery, I couldn’t wait to share what I had with anyone who could benefit. After all, I had the experience of developing a formula that worked for me: get active, join a social group that is part of something positive, build a resume volunteering.This path allowed me to escape a sedentary lifestyle — one in which I was always using drugs or trying to get drugs. One in which I was chasing away the voices with alcohol, committing small crimes and rejecting everything that didn’t reinforce my self-destructive lifestyle. This lifestyle landed me in psychiatric hospitals for months at a time (seven visits in total). But now, I understood that there was a way out. I could find both peace and freedom.I would never have “made it” without my peers who blazed this trail. Knowing I could follow in their footsteps — emulate their paths to recovery and even go on to help others myself — was amazing. I wanted to help people find their way out of darkness like I did. Beyond that, I wanted them to make it all the way to the other side, believing we could each actualize our visions.Today, I feel like peer support has the power to bring us all closer to our dreams. I encourage my peers to never underestimate our potential or limit our goals. While “I just want to keep taking my meds,” or “I want to stay out of the hospital this year,” may seem like good starting points, there is so much more we can aspire to.I am not any “further down the path” than anyone else. Some may excel in one particular area, and I may excel in another. I may need their help, or they may need mine. The point is that recovery is contagious. We just need something to be inspired by and excited about. In this case, it is sharing our triumph, our survival. Transforming a system that may have let us down and handing down what was given to us.Today, I work with my peers, and we volunteer with local projects and plan our own volunteer activities. We plan recovery events for the larger mental health community. We reach out to our neighbors. We are a part of the world and society. We fight stigma every day.To me, peer support is more than a job where you expose people to recovery. We have the chance to inspire. The people we join inspire us. Our energy, as a collective, branches out to our community. We may have had setbacks, but we come out ahead as leaders, sharing valuable experiences that can bring healing to the rest of society.Patrick Kaufmann’ s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” which was released on Sept. 20.

      "body": "Our nation’s mental health crisis is arguably at an all-time high. The demand for treatment has soared, exacerbating the shortage of mental health providers and adding to their already-significant waitlists. We are confronted with the ultimate health care supply chain problem — it takes almost a decade to train a psychiatrist and more than six years to train a licensed social worker. And we simply can’t wait that long.The dire shortage of mental health professionals and increased demand for providers, coupled with insurance issues and coverage gaps, leave many people without adequate access to mental health care. And for marginalized populations, the lack of access to culturally appropriate mental health care is even more dire.We are two psychiatrists working in the national mental health advocacy arena, representing hundreds of thousands of families as well as clinical and scientific advances, and we believe a non-clinical solution can help immediately: peer support.People often assume that talking about mental health (and suicidal thoughts) may make the situation worse. In the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention’s (AFSP) 2020 Harris Poll, over 90% of American adults say they would want to help someone in their life who is feeling suicidal, however a majority say they need knowledge or skills to effectively engage. Of those polled who were struggling, 69% identified barriers that keep them from discussing their experiences with others, including shame, fear of judgment or not knowing what to say.Every culture has its own version of beliefs that perpetuate stigma: “buck up and stay strong,” “don’t show weakness,” “men don’t cry.” A multitude of beliefs rooted in a time when mental health was poorly understood discourage open communication and have the unintended consequence of keeping people suffering in silence. We know that isolating and keeping distress hidden not only leaves mental health problems to fester and worsen — it also increases the risk of suicide.However, one positive outcome of the pandemic has been that the universal rise in mental health distress led to progress in acknowledging what has always been true: it’s human to struggle, and we need each other to get through difficult times.Like never before, more of us are talking about the full spectrum of mental health experiences, including loneliness, pain and the comparison game (where we never seem good enough compared with others). More of us are sharing on deeper levels with family, friends, colleagues and even strangers. We also have new opportunities through support groups, social media and even workplace groups to find other people who are experiencing similar mental health challenges such as depression, anxiety, substance use, PTSD, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia.In NAMI’s new book “You Are Not Alone,” more than 125 people interviewed attested to their experience that shame and stigma still prevent many conversations around mental health.  When they began having open conversations about their struggles, they began to experience profound insights, connection and progress. These interviewees volunteered to share their stories and use their real names in the book to reduce the shame and isolation they knew well. These brave testimonials have the potential to positively affect others who are struggling with their mental health. The radical idea that living with a mental health condition is nothing to be ashamed of and may even be considered a form of expertise (lived experience in the mental health advocacy world) — is both powerful and underused.Support groups are not a substitute for professionals. They are a resource that can offer people something unique: connection and the certainty that they are not alone. The peer movement is thriving on virtual platforms as well as in person, and there are many free, accessible and credible resources within reach to connect to peer support groups:As psychiatrists who both had turning points in our own lives related to lived experience or suicide loss, we were able to bring our full selves to this work through speaking from not only our clinical and scientific expertise, but also from our lived experience. Within our nationwide networks at NAMI and AFSP, we are witnessing the healing power of connection through shared experiences.By speaking out, we not only receive validation and support, but we realize that we can offer comfort and hope to others. Those who want to do more can learn how to invite dialogue, truly listen without judgment and have deeper conversations. More than ever, our society is saying it wants and needs guidance to engage in these conversations in supportive ways, which means increasing cultural awareness, humility and availability around helpful resources to reach everyone.Of course, we need many more professionals and ways to bring them into this remarkable and rewarding field. In the meantime, those experiencing mental health challenges should know that there are people who understand, who can offer support and help them move forward. You’ll be surprised how opening up more authentic conversations and connecting with peer support are two avenues that can help in powerful ways.Christine Yu Moutier, M.D., serves as Chief Medical Officer of the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.Ken Duckworth, M.D. serves as NAMI’s Chief Medical Officer.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "At some point in our lives, many of us will try psychotherapy and then decide whether to continue to engage in a full course of treatment with that provider (which may last for weeks, months or years). This decision is, typically, based on a judgment of whether the benefits of a course of psychotherapy with a given provider are worth the cost in terms of finances, time and effort.Through conversations with friends, family and colleagues, we have come to believe that most psychotherapy clients don’t know how to judge whether they are receiving quality treatment that will help them to achieve their goals. To facilitate this judgment and decision, we propose 10 questions for any client to ask their provider.All therapists should be willing and able to provide “good” answers to these questions no later than the third session. Good answers provide information that will help you assess your therapist’s competence, whether treatment is evidence-based and time-limited and whether your therapist will systematically monitor your problems/symptoms/challenges. Good answers will also clarify your therapist’s views on your case and make clear whether treatment aligns with your goals and values.“Bad” answers, by contrast, provide no useful information. They are vague, unclear, confusing or indicate you are receiving less than ideal treatment, perhaps from an unqualified therapist.Ultimately, discussion guided by these 10 questions can build trust and facilitate your therapeutic relationship. Be empowered to ask these questions and find a therapist and treatment who best suits your needs.A good answer might go something like this: “You have asked for my help to reduce your symptoms of worry. I will address these issues, by helping you to increase your psychological flexibility while living according to your values.”A bad answer may look like this: “It will require more sessions for me to know and to be able to tell you.”A good answer could sound like: “Your worries seem to attach themselves to everything you think about. You feel like the worry helps you to avoid bad outcomes, but your life has become small. You spend most of your time at home, where you feel safe, but isolated, numb and depressed.”A possible bad answer might sound like: “We’ll figure this out together.”Good answer: “Using Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), I will help you to identify and live according to your values despite your worries. Your life will become bigger, and you will react less to particular states of mind and mood.”Bad answer: “Whatever you want it to be.”Good answer: “You will learn to use a variety of techniques to live according to your values in the present moment regardless of the challenges you face. For example, you will learn acceptance and mindfulness techniques.”Bad answer: “You have to experience the treatment to understand how it works.”Good answer: “In the first session, you completed measures of psychological flexibility, mindfulness, depression and worry. You will complete all measures again at the end of treatment, and some measures a few additional times. Improvement will be indicated by higher scores on measures of psychological flexibility and use of mindfulness, with no change or less depression and worry.”Bad answer: “Sometimes I will ask you if you are doing any better than when you began therapy. I will try to do this on a regular basis.”Good answer: “This treatment will require approximately 12, 50-minute sessions. In approximately the tenth session, we will examine your scores on the measures completed that week to determine whether we can stop therapy after the twelfth session, or if it would be better to add a few more sessions.”Bad answer: “I don’t know how many sessions this will take. We will know when to stop when you feel better.”Good answer: “I expect you to be on time, be sober, be open and honest and to complete homework assignments between sessions. I will regularly ask for updates regarding your well-being and functioning, and for feedback regarding how you think we are doing.”Bad answer: “I expect you to trust that I know what I’m doing, and to follow my lead throughout therapy. I expect you not to ask a lot of questions. I am the expert. You can expect me to help you to get better.”Good answer: “There are other psychotherapies that might help you, including cognitive therapy. Medications, such as venlafaxine, might also be helpful.”Bad answer: “This is the best treatment for your problem. I wouldn’t worry about other treatments.”Good answer: “There is modest research support for ACT for anxiety disorders and for depression. I will provide you with a website address where you can review articles about the treatment and supporting evidence.”Bad answer: “The type of treatment I practice can be applied to fix just about any problem. I’ve had a lot of clients who improved from my treatment.”Good answer: “I received training in ACT for anxiety and for depression from an accredited graduate school and internship and have practiced ACT professionally for 10 years.”Bad answer: “I have many years of experience.”Ultimately, when we make the choice to begin psychotherapy, we have to keep in mind some practical considerations. Is this process helpful and worth the time, money and effort? As a client, you have the right to clear communication from your therapist as you navigate these questions.

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.Sept. 17 marks the fifth annual National Physician Suicide Awareness Day, a day dedicated to preventing suicide and reminding physicians that they are not alone. NAMI supports physician mental health and wants to ensure that access to support — and caring for those who care for us — remains a priority.Physician suicide is a topic historically shrouded in stigma and secrecy. While an exact statistic is difficult to pinpoint, we know some estimates show that suicide affects doctors at a rate that is 1.4 – 2.3 times higher than the general population. Clearly, there is a need for awareness and action.If you’re a physician, it’s time to talk about it.Suicide is a complex problem, with multiple risk factors that can change with time, and rarely due to a singular cause or event. This is true for everyone, including physicians. However, there are additional factors particular to the profession of medicine.For example, physicians are problem-solvers, healers who undergo rigorous training — and this mindset may make it difficult to accept that you need support. You may subject yourself to unrealistic standards of perfection and may judge your self-worth by whether or not you reach them. Constantly striving for perfection can take a toll on you over time.Additionally, you may experience trauma and moral injury in the course of your work, and these factors can lead to depression and substance use, as well as suicidal thoughts. Physicians of all specialties also face burnout, a stress reaction that builds up over time and results in mental exhaustion, cynicism and a sense of hopelessness. Prolonged stress can have a serious effect on both physical and mental health, and burnout is a common reason for leaving the field of medicine.“Burnout has many dimensions — psychological, physical, spiritual and more — but in the simplest of terms, it is an erosion of the soul. And that is an awful feeling, one that alarms and saddens doctors, who seriously question why they went into medicine in the first place.” – Dr. Michael Myers.While diagnostically different, burnout, moral injury and depression share many overlapping features, including a significant impact on mood, sleep and energy levels. These factors interact in complex ways and can sometimes be difficult to differentiate.You may resent that your treatment decisions are often hampered or overruled by distant bureaucratic or insurance-driven dictates. You may also become frustrated by having to devote more time to electronic health records and other administrative burdens than patient care — the very reason you chose to become a physician. These are frequent causes of burnout.Scenarios like these can also result in moral injury, as physicians are sometimes unable to alter the course of care decisions that are beyond their control, yet medically and ethically flawed. Or you may face the rising frequency of treating victims of senseless trauma, scenarios that expose you to suffering and lead to a loss of empathy or feelings of intense anger.While those suffering from burnout may not necessarily experience moral injury or develop depression, it’s important for you to understand the symptoms you’re experiencing, so you can access the kind of support needed to regain a sense of well-being.It’s also key to preventing an escalation of symptoms. Untreated symptoms of depression can be dangerous, as depression is a major factor in suicide. Similarly, if you’re experiencing burnout that hasn’t yet led to depression, managing stress and finding solutions to specific challenges can help you prevent negative mental and physical effects from worsening.Don’t let stigma convince you that it’s “just burnout.” Identify what you’re feeling, be aware of warning signs, and explore options for support.Even physicians who recognize warning signs may still struggle to access support. Personal stigma or concerns over how colleagues or family might react may make you hesitant to seek treatment. Or maybe you feel reluctant to focus on your own distress and mental health symptoms when the patients you treat are battling illnesses that are “visible” or “testable.” There may not be a blood test for depression, but it still presents in the form of mental and physical symptoms, and treating those symptoms can help you feel better. Your patients would never want you to suffer in silence — neither would your peers and loved ones.Even aside from these concerns, physicians in many states face an additional risk: the fear of professional repercussions if they seek mental health support. You may worry about losing your license, hospital privileges and job if you disclose access to mental health treatment.NAMI believes that this is unacceptable – seeking treatment should be encouraged without such fear. We’ve taken a stand on this issue with a public policy statement regarding licensure application questions on mental health for medical professionals:NAMI supports limiting medical license application questions about mental health to only those necessary and relevant to assess an individual’s current ability to practice medicine safely and competently. NAMI further supports and encourages the use of language in the licensure application process that is supportive of seeking mental health treatment.”Medical professionals who would like access to confidential support are not alone. NAMI Frontline Wellness offers resources for professional support options that protect your privacy. You can also find information on warning signs, when to reach out for support, how to build resilience and strategies for wellness.You can also download the National Physician Suicide Awareness Day toolkit, which contains tips and resources for individuals and organizations. Share these resources with peers, your leadership and hospital or practice administrators.Remember that you and your peers are also a resource for support. If you’re struggling, or notice that a colleague appears to be, don’t wait. Taking action can be as simple as having a conversation that begins with, “It’s been rough around here the past few days. Are you doing ok?”Asking simple questions and acknowledging that your colleague seems to be struggling lets them know that someone cares and they don’t have to struggle alone. As a physician, you know what other physicians face, and that experience can make peer support invaluable. Talking through challenges and concerns and sharing strategies for wellness can help generate new ideas and motivation for self-care for both of you.You face many challenges and stressors each day, but there are ways to effectively cope with the resulting experiences and emotions. As you work hard to take care of your patients, remember that you’re at your best when you also care for your own health.If you or someone you know is in crisis, there are resources you can turn to.The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline offers free, confidential crisis counseling 24/7/365 just by dialing or texting 988.If you don’t want to talk on the phone, you can also text the Crisis Text Line for free 24/7 mental health support.

      "body": "On Aug. 27, 2012, I was admitted to the hospital again. I had been in a hypomanic/manic state for quite some time, and I began experiencing delusions and psychosis. I was 48 years old and had been cycling through the system (more often in the hospitals than out) for over 24 years. I was living in a 2005 Ford Taurus. I had lost my job, lost my family, lost my boyfriend and lost my hope. I was tired.While in the hospital, I attended groups (most of which I could lead as I had attended them so many times), I started back on my medications and made progress in my recovery. After five days, administrators told me that I was ready to be discharged, but I first needed to attend one more group. I was not interested in participating. In fact, my plan after leaving the hospital was to return to my car and take my life.That was the mindset with which I went to the group. To my surprise, it was not the usual group meeting — it was a NAMI In Our Own Voice presentation. I listened while two presenters shared their stories. One of the individuals, who was living a life I had only dreamed of, revealed that she had a diagnosis that was similar to mine. She shared she was married, had three children, worked a job she found fulfilling, attended college and volunteered to go back in the community and share her story of recovery. As they finished their presentations, I was in tears. The young lady came over to me, handed me her card and said that when I was discharged to give her a call, as she would like to talk with me further.That presentation was life changing for me. For the first time since my initial diagnosis in 1989 (when “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” was the movie of relevance), I had hope.The next day I was discharged. Instead of taking my life, I made the choice to call the local NAMI affiliate.I was provided resources to connect with the local homeless shelter, health department for trauma counseling and the NAMI Connection support groups. The local affiliate gave me a safe place to be where I felt accepted. They allowed me to use one of my passions (data entry) to support them as they needed assistance transferring data from one system to another — even though I was still experiencing symptoms.After participating in support groups, I was asked to train to become a facilitator. Shortly after, I was provided the opportunity to become a NAMI In Our Own Voice presenter. I also took the NAMI Peer-to-Peer class and started using the Wellness Recovery Action Plan (WRAP), in which I learned skills that would assist me in managing my chronic health conditions.Today, I live a life that far exceeds any delusion I ever had (and I had some pretty good ones).All these experiences have led me to where I am today in my wellness journey, and I have learned the power of hope, shared experiences and peer support. That’s why I am so glad to be included in NAMI’s first-ever book “You Are Not Alone.” I never want anyone to feel the way I did — I want them to have the support I found when I got involved in the NAMI community. My insightful conversations with Dr. Duckworth during the creation of this book allowed me to I reflect on the experiences and successes in recovery.  I wish this type of book had been available for me to read at the beginning of my mental health journey.Kimberly Comer’s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” releasing on Sept. 20.

      "body": "“Yes, I am a prisoner of sorts, but my prison isn't the house. It's my own thoughts that lock me up!” – V.C. AndrewsIntrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts that can pop up in our minds unannounced, at any time. Their repeated occurrence can make it hard to focus on daily tasks and sustain healthy relationships. They can be a symptom of common mental health conditions such as anxiety, depression or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).To address these often-debilitating thoughts and advance the conversation on mental illness, we need to understand how they manifest themselves in each mental health condition.Generalized Anxiety DisorderPeople with generalized anxiety disorder can battle impaired concentration, difficulty sleeping and excessive worry when intrusive thoughts pop into their minds. For instance, they may have repeated worrisome thoughts about someone getting hurt or developing an illness. They may worry that they will lose their job.These thoughts are not based on facts or past results — rather they are irrational and unlikely. However, they can seem very real and probable to someone who ruminates on them. These thoughts can be concerning to loved ones, especially when they start controlling the person’s behavior.DepressionRumination can also accompany depression. In this case, when a person has a problem, they may find themselves thinking about it repeatedly and analyzing it for hours. The person may focus more on problems instead of solutions, and this may stop them from undertaking important tasks.Examples of intrusive thoughts that accompany depression include seeing situations as “black- and-white,” assuming it will end disastrously because of past bad outcomes or viewing small mishaps in a magnified way. Another way in which intrusive thoughts affect people who have depression is that they can sometimes try to predict what someone is thinking, even if there’s no rationale for it. This can be distressing and take a toll on anxiety levels.Obsessive-Compulsive DisorderA 2020 study published in the journal PLOS showed that people with OCD may place less trust in their past experiences, leading to greater uncertainty, indecisiveness and explorative behaviors. In this study, the researchers asked 58 participants with various levels of OCD symptoms to complete a decision-making task by thinking about their reaction to past experiences and comparing them to more recent ones. The findings showed that participants with higher levels of OCD symptoms were less trusting of past experiences. As such, their environment seemed consistently unpredictable.This mistrust may cause intrusive urges, images or thoughts to arise, resulting in behavioral rituals, also known as compulsions. These can vary from compulsive handwashing, checking locks or switches or the repetitive pulling of hair (trichotillomania) or compulsive skin picking.Managing Stress LevelsExperiencing a high level of stress can cause intrusive thoughts. According to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the genetic factors that cause sleep problems when some people are stressed are the same that can make people with intrusive, ruminative thoughts have a higher rate of insomnia.This is one of the reasons why some of the most successful methods for battling anxiety and intrusive thinking involve curbing stress before it becomes a problem. In order to reduce stress and anxiety, developing emotional awareness is key. Signs that one is stressed include racing heart, experiencing changes in the stomach or bowel and having difficulty concentrating.Scientifically-proven means of reducing stress include controlled breathing, mindfulness meditation and reframing negative thoughts into more positive ones. Journaling, soothing fragrances (such as therapeutic-grade essential oils like lavender or orange), spending time in nature, yoga, meditation and exercise have all been found to lower stress hormone (cortisol) levels.Prioritizing SleepOne of the most important strategies for keeping intrusive thoughts or rumination at bay is to get quality sleep. Research produced by scientists at Binghamton University found that sleeping less than eight hours a night is linked to intrusive, repetitive thoughts. The researchers showed participants a series of images that were intended to produce emotional responses. They found that those who had experienced regular sleep disruptions had greater difficulty in shifting their attention away from negative information.Identify the Root of the FearIn addition to battling stress and embracing good sleep hygiene, people who have intrusive thoughts can also take a behavioral approach to this issue. One useful strategy is to identify the root causes of the disturbance. By knowing your core values and identifying your boundaries, it becomes easier to identify why specific situations or experiences provoke disgust, fear or other distressing emotions.For example, you may have experienced loss — perhaps the untimely death of someone you loved. This may begin to affect you negatively in other areas of your life. You may worry or experience intrusive thoughts that someone else close to you may pass suddenly, or in the same way. To help deal with this, you may develop repetitive behaviors that you think are going to solve the problem or stop it from happening.Rather than suppressing intrusive thoughts, you can take a mindful approach, accepting them without judgement but knowing that they do not define you and despite their strength, you can maintain healthy thinking processes.Facing Intrusive Thoughts Head-OnYou should avoid “running away” from situations that can cause you stress, as this can push you into rumination. If you find that intrusive thoughts severely or persistently interfere with your health and well-being, consider seeing a therapist. Approaches like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) can help you understand the vital link between your thoughts, emotions and behaviors. Your therapist can suggest behavioral changes and ask you to recognize how these changes affect the way you think or feel about a situation. They can also help you reframe negative thoughts into positive ones.People who find that intrusive thoughts are exacerbating mental conditions like depression, anxiety and OCD should seek professional help — as should those who are unable to undertake daily tasks or sustain relationships because of intrusive thoughts. Therapy combined with medication and a holistic approach to health and self-care are important ways forward in the healing and wellness process. What works well for one person may not for another, so finding a personalized way to deal with these issues is the best way forward.Jackie Edwards is a freelance writer who has had lifelong experience of anxiety and depression.

      "body": "My name is Judith Marie Kuzmak Viers, or just Judy. And my childhood friends call me Judes. My neighbor used to sing the Beatles song \"Hey Jude,\" which includes the lyrics, \"take a sad song and make it better.” That lyric is why I choose to share my story. Beyond being a music fan, I'm a mom, a writer, an artist, a hiker and a dancer. And I try to make the world a better place.I have been on my own mental health journey and witnessed the painful turns in the journeys of others; I lost two loved ones during the COVID-19 pandemic to suicide. I don't want anyone else to go down that road. I want people to know that every day is a new day and we should never give up on life.I hope that my own story and struggle will help someone else and inspire them to take the next step in their own healing journey.I started suffering from symptoms of depression at 12 years old when my newborn sister died. Having been raised Christian, I was devastated by her death and that my prayers for her life were not answered. Yet, I also truly believed I could pray the depression away. By my 30s, several years after my mom lost her battle to breast cancer, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and began experiencing severe manic episodes.I began to feel like I was a hopeless cause. When I was depressed, I believed that whoever tried to help me would be dragged into my deep dark hole of despair. So, I stayed silent. There were days when the only thing I did was breathe, drink water and eat a little junk food — I didn’t even go outside. I remember trying to speak or write, but I wasn’t able to do so because I experienced brain fog as a symptom of my depression.My hopelessness got to the point where I began to doubt every positive prior experience. I eventually got treatment because of something my father said to me years earlier. In 2003, after the funeral of my young neighbor who died by suicide, my dad said that suicide is “the worst thing that can happen to a parent.” Those words resonated with me. In 2011, I was in a low state, had difficulty sleeping, experienced racing thoughts and even developed a plan to end my life. But I remembered my dad’s words and voluntarily went to the hospital to be safe. Even though my mind said, “the world would be better off without you,” my dad’s words rang true, and I know my actions would devastate him.The depression eventually faded, but then I began experiencing the highs of mania. Having a manic episode is traumatic and embarrassing — and processing the shame you feel for your thoughts and actions while manic is a complex, lifelong process. I was involuntarily hospitalized multiple times for mania.For 20 years, I prayed alone in my room, hoping that my depression and mania would go away, but I never found any long-lasting success. Then I discovered that prayer without action does not work for me — and I need to rely on several different wellness tools.Part of my recovery required admitting that I need professional help too. My personal coping mechanisms and spirituality were not enough to tackle my bipolar disorder alone. Now, I work with an incredible therapist. In therapy, I share everything I am doing, like being a NAMI In Our Own Voice Presenter, and assess if any of my words or behaviors seem manic. I have a plan in place where two close friends or family members can contact my therapist if they are worried that I'm manic, since I can be more receptive to hearing that I am manic if I can process the information with my therapist. I also work with a wonderful psychiatrist who knows my history of adverse side effects to medications and makes sure to prescribe appropriate doses.I also make sure to maintain social connections. I am good friends with the director of On Our Own of Carroll County, a wellness and recovery nonprofit organization that has helped be throughout my mental health journey. I still use my coping tools of going church and spending time with my close friends.Now, I understand that being able to seek and find the help I need was the answer to my prayer. Oftentimes, we need to step out of our comfort zone to get the help we need. While my faith was temporarily affected by my mental illness, it is now so much stronger. Life truly can be a healing journey.I imagine being 90 years old and thinking about my life with peace and pride that I truly did the best I could. That concept of living the best life I can — doing what is on my heart — is my greatest motivation and my definition of success.I already had my master’s degree in social work before I was hospitalized or received mental health treatment. But what took me years to learn from books, I was truly able to internalize through lived experience — and I learned so much more about the extremes of bipolar disorder through my own experience than I could have learned from a textbook. I understand how to relate to others. I can empathize with those experiencing depression and mania. I remember the lies I believed — that life will never get better and you can’t open up about your struggles to loved ones. I now know nothing in life is permanent, even severe mental illness can be treated and friendships are built by being open in the good and bad times. Not only have I been on my own healing journey, I can help others in their journeys as well.I've even started a non-profit, Share Hope Through Art, to use art as a way to share my story. I incorporate sayings like \"you matter\" and \"the world is better with you in it\" into my work. I'm not sure what my future holds, but I hope to continue to find peace in knowing that I’m doing the best I can. Right now, it's being the best mom I can be and doing what I can to be a ray of hope in people's lives. I want to illustrate how hope and healing are possible — and we should never give up on life.Judith Marie Kuzmak Viers is the founder of Share HOPE through ART and an author.

      "body": "Being a Black woman with a mental health condition poses serious challenges to living life to its fullest. I have faced discrimination, exclusion and barriers to both care and opportunities. However, living with a mental health condition has been the most difficult of my three marginalized identities; I constantly have to prove why I deserve respect and dignity, why I am not dangerous, why I am not a failure and why I am just a person.False narratives about mental illness pervade every part of our society — and being bombarded by stereotypes and misinformation takes its toll and adds to the challenge of maintaining my emotional wellness. My recovery required finding the right people, places and resources, while trying to make a difference in my community and sharing my story.My healing really began when I became a member of NAMI. The NAMI In Our Own Voice (IOOV) training and support groups helped me grow, accept and embrace who I am. They also taught me to be resilient. As a certified public accountant, I particularly enjoyed sharing my own IOOV story at law firms, financial institutions and schools because, despite one’s socioeconomic status and education, anyone can have a mental health condition.Later I joined Fountain House, a nonprofit organization that provided me with a support system — people who understand my experience and avoid making judgments. I love just being myself and not pretending to be “ok” all the time, as I have had to do in other environments. For instance, when I'd show up in a work environment, I’d make every effort not to talk to myself and not to look different because people were watching. But at Fountain House, if I talked to myself, they wouldn’t think anything of it.In this community, I have been able to build relationships and meet people where they are: whether they're well, becoming unwell or even in a crisis. We’re able to build rapport and trust with each other, and our goal becomes empowering our peers.Far too often, policies and programs for people with mental illness are created in a top-down approach. I always say, \"No, no, no. It has to be from peer up. It's about us.\" Throughout my mental health journey, I have learned that we know how best to engage with other people who look, walk, talk and act like us. We speak the same language.Navigating a mental health journey is exhausting work and resilience. I had a long history of pain and trauma to overcome; I grew up in a verbally and physically abusive home. My mother was unwell and treated me as though I was \"bad person and a problem.\" If you hear words like this for long enough, you start to believe it. I grew up alone and afraid. But somehow, I survived. And my efforts toward resilience and survival taught me that changing a situation requires my resourcefulness to devise a solution. Now, I thrive on making positive changes in the community and helping others. It’s also cathartic and a critical part of my own recovery.One of the positive changes I have focused on is improving outcomes when people who are unhoused or living with mental health conditions and substance use disorders interact with police during emergencies. I designed a peer-driven emergency response model called the Person–Centered Intervention Training (PCIT) Mental Health Response Pilot in Fort Greene Park in Brooklyn, NY.PCIT consists of two parts: training and response. The training component teaches participants how to use person-centered, strength-based and culturally responsive language when engaging with people. Care and Empathy are so important in helping people. For the response component, crisis-trained peers or a Social Well-Being Team (SWBT) tour Fort Greene Park respectfully connecting with park patrons. SWBT’s goal is to destigmatize mental health, validate people’s experiences, provide emotional support and connect people to treatment while diverting them from the justice system.A big step in my journey was sharing my story with Dr. Ken Duckworth for his upcoming book, “You Are Not Alone.” I felt it was important to participate in the project because I wanted to inspire and give hope to others, particularly people of color. I want people to know that recovery is a journey, but it is rewarding and possible.I wish that I had been given access to role models or mentors when I struggled to manage and cope with my condition (at work, with family and in relationships). I hope that by reading this book, people will find the answers that they are seeking. We are not alone, and we all need support.Christina Sparrock’s story is featured in NAMI’s first-ever book, “You Are Not Alone: The NAMI Guide to Navigating Mental Health,” releasing on September 20.

      "body": "If you or someone you know is experiencing a mental health, suicide or substance use crisis or emotional distress, reach out 24/7 to the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline (formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline) by dialing or texting 988 or using chat services at suicidepreventionlifeline.org to connect to a trained crisis counselor. You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.If you are reading this, you likely know that suicide is often a product of incomprehensible pain, and results in the heavy grief that suicide loss leaves in its wake.As behavioral health professionals, concerned family members and friends, we know even the most radiant individuals have attempted and died by suicide. Where others see statistics, we recall faces and names.This National Suicide Prevention Awareness Month, it is important that we assess the state of suicide and take a few moments to remind ourselves of the basic, and sometimes overlooked, steps we can take to help those at risk of suicide.In June of 2020, researchers at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that about twice as many people reported having serious thoughts of suicide than they did prior to the pandemic. Although the pandemic did not lead to the dramatic increase in completed suicides as some had predicted, rates remain high. The most recent full-year statistics, for 2020, found that 45,979 people died of suicide.The CDC also found that suicide was the second leading cause of death among people ages 10-14 and 25-34. Research also found that some 1.2 million Americans attempted suicide and rates of suicide are highest among American Indian/Alaska Natives and people over the age of 85.The pandemic created more stressors to mental health issues, adding to an already strained mental health crisis. Multiple issues continue to fuel it, among them young peoples’ social media-influenced feelings of inadequacy, increasing rates of substance abuse, financial stress caused by inflation and an increasingly divisive political landscape.It is fitting that September is also National Recovery Month. In 2020, 40.3 million people in the U.S. over the age of 12 had a substance use disorder in the past year. Our national substance abuse crisis continues to dramatically impact suicide rates today.The demand for mental health services continues to outpace available resources. Many mental health providers who transitioned to Telebehavioral health during the pandemic do not wish to go back in-office. The rents and general costs of maintaining an office have gone up, and many providers would rather not have those expenses. Although these providers are still available via Telebehavioral health, members may face a shortage if they prefer to see a provider in person.While there are disparities among different populations, many still experience stigma surrounding mental health and suicidal ideation. However, we’re seeing some progress, particularly among younger generations that increasingly see the value and need for mental health-oriented care. The rollout of the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline also reflects a dramatic shift in public attitudes towards suicide prevention and is a significant victory.Given the state of suicide, how can we, as behavioral health professionals, concerned family members and friends help prevent suicide? The first step is to revisit the basics:Successful public health efforts incorporate public advocacy and learning. We must continue to advocate for depression and suicidal ideation screening in every primary care visit. Just as importantly, education is crucial. This includes helping family members and friends have easy access to informational resources they can use to help those in mental distress.Indifference, prolonged sadness and a sudden desire to give away prized possessions, are just a few of the signs to watch for. Individuals who are experiencing a crisis, like the death of a loved one, the end of a relationship, the loss of a job or a significant financial loss are also at increased risk of depression and by extension possibly suicidal ideation.Don’t be afraid to ask someone how they feel, if something is wrong or share with them that you have noticed they are not their usual self. Then listen without judgment.Those contemplating suicide may hesitate to get help on their own, but you can help by offering to accompany them to visit a provider, to stay with them while phoning the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline or even call 988 yourself to get help for someone else who is in crisis.

      "body": "Octopi. Octopuses. I don't care how you pluralize them; I just love them. But I never gave much thought to this deep-water creature until recently.I was having lunch with a colleague who is an astrobiologist. I love the ocean, and I brought up that I was going to an aquarium. She said I should see the aquarium’s octopus show and continued to talk about how magnificent octopi are. Then, she mentioned a recent study (and TED Talk) determining how an octopus functions: each of the creature’s eight “arms” is covered in hundreds of “suckers” — and each of these suckers contains thousands of receptors (for comparison, human fingers only have a few hundred receptors). Essentially, each sucker senses its surroundings and sends the information back to the main brain of the octopus. Additionally, each arm of the octopus can move either with the main brain or independently.At the time, I thought the study sounded interesting and moved on with the conversation.It wasn't until a year later when I was diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (DID) that I really thought about what my colleague was saying. Each sucker can be independent or work together with the main brain.As I thought more about what my colleague had told me, I decided to learn more. Sometimes, I found, the tiny individual brains in the suckers do not agree, so the suckers and arms may act differently. For example, one sucker may think something is food, but a sucker on another arm may think it is a threat. So, while one of the octopus’s arms is wrapping around it, another arm may be pulling away.The arms can do all this while bypassing the octopus’s main brain, meaning the main brain may not be aware of what is going on in the octopus’s extremities.If you have DID or know someone living with it, this may sound familiar. One identity (also known as an “alter” or a “part”) may experience something that “main” identity is unaware of, or several identities may react to the same stimulus in opposite ways.The comparison really struck me: the suckers of an octopus function much like the identities of someone with DID.Those of us with DID have experienced this phenomenon at work. The host functions much like the main brain of the octopus. Two alters, like the octopus’s suckers, may not agree on how to handle a situation. Or one alter may not even know another exists. Each alter experiences the world in a unique way, and they respond according to their past experiences. However, the person may or may not know what their alters are doing — so the \"main brain\" may not be aware of how the \"suckers\" react.Ultimately, the suckers, arms and main brain of the octopus work together for survival, and the octopus is able to thrive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth. Even though the various parts of the system may not all agree, they work together to protect and nourish the octopus. Without each individual sucker, the octopus would not be able to survive its environment.That is exactly why we have our alters: survival. They protect us and allow us to thrive in harsh conditions. They each have their own experiences and responses to situations, but ultimately, they are present to help us thrive.If we look at an octopus as a microcosm for how our own DID brains can work together, we can see how it is possible to thrive when alters disagree, even in the harshest conditions.When I first became aware of and met some of my alters, I was scared. I didn't know why, but I found them terrifying. However, I eventually realized that my alters were a coping mechanism that my brain created to help me. Even though some may be scary to me, they are ultimately acting in a way that they think is best for \"me.\" I discovered that one alter, who seemed like a monster, was actually created to hold my self-doubt and anger, which is why I react to it with fear.But this alter is simply there to protect me.Just like the octopus arm that pulls away from food because it thinks it is protecting the whole octopus, my \"scary\" alter was doing the same thing, evoking the flight response in order to try to remove us from the situation.As scientists learn more about how the octopus and its suckers work (and sometimes, don’t work) together, I hope we can also gain a better understanding of how alters and DID in general can work as well.The 2020 film “The Octopus Teacher” beautifully illustrates how the entire system of the octopus operates — and sheds light on my own experience. One section of the film explains the challenges of the octopus’s arms working against each other. I couldn’t help but notice that the situation feels similar to fighting amongst my alters.Before I saw this footage, I was only able to imagine or speculate what it was like in the \"inner world\" of my mind. But right before my eyes was physical evidence of what happens, including how it feels when one alter shuts down or goes silent. It gets \"cut\" off from the rest, just like the octopus' arm did when it was attacked by the shark. But, just like the octopus, it eventually comes back and rejoins the group effort, doing its best to protect the whole being.This documentary was life-changing for me. Getting a visual representation of how my mind works is liberating, and it has given me a deeper understanding of myself and my alters.All because of an octopus.Pamela Achenbach Covert, PhD is a writer and mother to two active little boys, and she has been diagnosed with DID.

      "body": "A psychiatrist once told me that I understood my illness better than many of her patients. I took that as a compliment because I have worked hard to understand my schizoaffective disorder diagnosis and to recognize my symptoms. For example, I am now able to take a step back when I start to believe something strongly (like someone being in love with me), reflect and determine what is happening. Then, I can decide if the belief is a delusion or not. Learning to identify my delusions has been a process, but I have found a method that works for me — and I hope to share what I have learned.I keep a chart on my refrigerator of schizophrenia symptoms that I experience. This helps guide me through my feelings and beliefs, and it offers me an explanation for my emotions and actions. If I find myself believing I am an important public figure or existing in a fantasy world, I can refer to my chart to evaluate the situation. In this case, the chart tells me that this belief is a grandiose delusion (and a common one, as I’ve learned from talking to other people diagnosed with schizophrenia).If I notice that the voices in my head are distracting — causing me to forget where I’ve put things or forget what I want to say in a conversation — I can look to the chart to remember that forgetful behavior is a symptom.I also have a chart listing the symptoms of exaggerated thinking. I usually look at this list for comfort after having a traumatic delusion, like believing I am being stalked, hunted, framed or tricked. I've learned this is another one of the common manifestations of schizoaffective disorder, called persecutory delusions. I feel a little less alone when I look at the chart on my refrigerator. I even feel like my illness is “textbook schizophrenia” — a reminder that others experience this, too.Attending group therapy, where I can listen to others describe their delusions and verbalize my own delusions, has helped me to identify my delusions. While knowing medical terminology can be important, we learn the most from each other by describing our experience with a goal of understanding the unreality of a delusion.Determining as a group that delusions are not actually happening — rather, they are symptoms of schizophrenia — is a huge step in accepting our diagnosis. Group therapy has also given me tools for evaluating my symptoms when I am alone. If I hear a voice outside the door, I now know to open the front door to prove to myself that no one is there and that the voice is a delusion.Leaning on the supportive people in my life has been critical in understanding and managing delusions. My mom helps me with certain tasks, like editing my writing, when my disorganized thoughts and difficulty concentrating keep me from remembering grammar rules and syntax. She also helps me to clarify my thoughts and dig deeper to understand how a delusion makes me feel at the time I am experiencing it. Accepting that I needed this kind of help has been an important step for both my writing career and my personal growth. For those of us who have a severe mental illness diagnosis, there is no shame in asking for the help or accommodations we need.Medication has been critical to managing my symptoms. Being on the appropriate regimen makes it possible for me to recognize a symptom before I act on it. Often, my perceptions can be distorted by the schizophrenia, and I believe certain circumstances require action from me, when, in reality, they do not. For example, If I don’t receive mail for three days straight, I might be tempted to contact my mailman to see why I am not getting mail. Fortunately, medication has helped me identify these thoughts before making decisions.Moving forward, I hope to continue living a productive life in which my symptoms can’t control me. Researching and putting into practice what I learn about my diagnosis allows me to step out of myself and look inward to better explain myself to my doctor, family and friends. Being able to articulate my experience can be a relief.I will always have a deep desire to understand as much as possible about my diagnosis of schizophrenia. Knowledge gives me power over my symptoms. With information, I can be a vital contributor on my support team.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

None of these are easy to treat, especially my depression.I often find myself worrying about the likelihood of relapse. With major depressive disorder, I experience episodes, meaning I’m not depressed all the time. An episode is defined as a period of two weeks or more where you experience at least five symptoms most of the day, nearly every day, including a depressed mood, loss of interest in activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness and suicidal ideation. (However, this is not a comprehensive list).According to the American Psychiatric Association, major depressive disorder is highly recurrent; symptoms return for at least 50% of those who recover from a first episode of depression. Approximately 80% of those with a history of two episodes will have another recurrence. One study found that, on average, individuals with a history of depression will have five to nine separate episodes in their lifetimes.I’ve already had at least two depressive episodes since I was formally diagnosed at 19 years old. I’d like to think I’ll be “ready” should an episode come my way, but I panic now even if I have a bad day.“Do I need to call my psychiatrist?”\n“Maybe I should change my medications.” \n“I’m going to go on low battery mode.”And so on.I’m always walking a tight rope. Even though I feel great now — and have for months — I still have to be extremely careful. I need to get enough sleep — not too much or too little. I must take my pills at the same time, twice a day, every day, and keep up with the refills. I have to follow a healthy diet, drink tons of water and avoid any triggers, like violent or sad TV shows and books. I avoid napping during the day. I remain active. I don’t drink alcohol and try to steer clear of stressful situations. I stick to a daily routine and structure as much as I can. While these measures might seem like “normal,” responsible behavior, they are more than that — they are lifesaving. If I “break the rules,” I become emotional, impatient and irritable. I lose control of myself, and my thoughts go to a dark and negative place.This is the major challenge of having several mental health conditions; sometimes, it can feel like negative thoughts are always waiting to slip through a crack and infiltrate your mind. At first, the thoughts and symptoms can be more subtle — I stop showering as much, then I take long naps during the day. I skip a day of brushing my teeth. But once my illness has me in its grip, it can be relentless and painful. I lose hope. I isolate. I give in to the darkness, losing my grip on the tight rope.Another challenge is battling shame and self-blame. Often, I wonder, “Shouldn’t I be stronger now? Didn’t I already crawl back from the pits of hell? I have grit. I have coping skills and an amazing support system.” But I have learned to ignore that little voice in my head telling me I “should be” better or that I’m unworthy.It has been a long journey. I’ve spent the past four years working on myself, and it’s been challenging. I’ve had bad days, even horrible ones, but I’ve kept going, and now I’m living my best life. I made that happen, with the help of my support group, therapist and medication.And here I am now — voluntarily getting up at 5:00 am every morning. I take my kids to school and pick them up. I shower and brush my teeth daily. I have a column on mental health in the local newspaper, and I’m the communications manager for NAMI Greater Corpus Christi. I have found the right support, treatment and purpose.I want to help others because I felt so alone in my journey, and it literally could’ve killed me. I want to lend my voice to those who can’t use theirs.I understand that I have a mental illness, and that it’s never going away. That’s hard to accept, but even though the odds are stacked against me, I’m still betting on myself.Heather Loeb is the creator of “Unruly Neurons,” a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "As I weathered the experience of another episode, I realized how important telling my story could be.When my psychosis set in, I didn’t feel in control of my mind. Chronic stress had eroded my ability to regulate emotions and think clearly. Then, on Nov. 13, 2021, my worst symptoms began: paranoia, obsessive thoughts, compulsions and debilitating fear. Even the coping mechanisms and strategies I had worked so hard to develop could not fight these symptoms or control my psychological state. I panicked, having illogical worries about my home.Early in the morning, I rushed and packed some essential clothes in a handheld luggage bag and searched for my passport, which my wife had hidden (knowing I was struggling with my mental health). I vividly hallucinated that mental health officials assisted my wife in blocking the exit door. In reality, my wife stood in front of the door alone. In my frightened state of mind, I shoved past her. I had vividly imagined engaging in physical combat with the officers) in a battle to escape my home. I had a bizarre feeling I was involved in physically lashing out at my wife before frantically fleeing from my house and dashing out in the gloom of the street lighting, which lifted the early morning's shade of darkness. At the same time, I was driving away at an excessive speed in our car, heading toward the passport office 30 miles away before trying to leave the country.About 10 miles into the journey, the police apprehended me and asked me to park my vehicle. At the time, I had no idea my wife had called the police to report a person experiencing psychosis. I believed that the medical practitioners and the police were devious and engaged in corrupt practices. I believed I was hearing the voices of intelligent people telepathically. Ultimately, I was detained and transported to a mental health facility. This hospitalization did not give me peace of mind; I struggled to make social contact with fellow patients I can only describe as “odd balls.”My medical treatment continued until I was fully discharged in December of 2021. Although I have developed an awareness of my condition, I found it challenging to continue being psychologically resilient to live a long and healthy life. Indeed, I still I over-engage with my thoughts and emotions and get trapped in my own mind. However, I have agreed to take medication regularly.It's fair to say it has been a tough time for my brain — a journey learning how to survive and thrive. It can be a vicious circle living with a mental health condition. Yet, I feel empowered by having the agency to manage my symptoms.Schizophrenia is a complex mental health condition, but I have found my rhythm with treatment. The regimen that works best for me includes antipsychotic medication integrated with psychotherapy, practicing self-care and limiting stress. While this is not a cure, it allows me to live with minimal symptoms. In addition, I now understand how much I benefit from taking antipsychotic medications regularly, which has helped control symptoms and prevented frequent relapses. I have also found that writing about my experience empowers me and informs others about wellness and recovery.As I look to the future, I hope there's a low chance that I will continue to have episodes of psychosis relapse. But I understand every journey has setbacks; I have relapsed before and can feel deterioration over time. So, I will stick with my treatment and continue to share my story.Karl Lorenz Willett is a writer and father who has battled schizophrenia for over 40 years.

      "body": "Socialization is particularly important for the emotional well-being of people with serious mental illness (SMI). This is true for several reasons. When people maintain their connections with others, they are more likely to be tuned in to the world around them, given that social expectations require attention, commitment and concentration. For people with SMI, social interaction can stabilize mood, help them to feel grounded and connected to others and allow them to feel more engaged in their recovery process.Isolation is one of the most gut-wrenching aspects of having a mental health condition: people need support, but they may simultaneously push away support because of their symptoms. While the specific benefits of socialization for each diagnosis are unclear, the unwavering need for people with mental health conditions to develop and cultivate meaningful, supportive and organic connections is as clear as day.When my psychosis began, I was isolated, ostracized and abandoned by friends. When my symptoms became apparent, I was in my final semester of college. My friends, who had become accustomed to the person they had known for three years, were confused and alarmed. As my psychosis worsened, I became moody and paranoid — which was troubling to anyone who knew me and observed the radical changes in my thinking and behavior.For so many people with active psychosis symptoms, this is the outcome. Those dealing with psychosis may seem strange; perhaps engaging in bizarre behavior or have altered speech. People may also exhibit ill-timed and drastic changes in their disposition.This state, which can be \"scary\" or \"strange\" to some, is the point at which people experiencing psychosis need stabilization, peer connection and another organic support best cultivated by good health. The added burden of social disconnection and isolation is one reason these mental health conditions are so severe, difficult to \"bounce back\" from and dangerous. We feel increasingly isolated and misunderstood as we endure these confusing and hazardous states.My behavior years ago was so alarming to my friends that my roommate telephoned my family one evening, believing I had a plan to poison his food. As my psychosis worsened, the ability to care for myself was completely diminished. My isolation from friends, and difficulty engaging in adequate self-care, meant I had no support to lean on when I ran into issues on campus. No longer surrounded by friends, I had no one to troubleshoot what was an increasingly extensive list of problems. As a result, the issues became too overwhelming and complicated to address, given my increasing level of confusion from psychosis.People with psychosis benefit from support: the more support, the more people available to bounce ideas off of and discuss issues productively. As problems begin to mount and symptoms worsen, the need for additional support is increasingly critical. When we include others in our worldview, our perception of reality expands. The communicated experience of others contributes to the way we come to understand our world. The additional perspective is essential for people disturbed by fear and paranoia. Counsel from a friend or relative unpacking irrational beliefs is soothing and reassuring when someone is in distress from psychosis.Socialization can also be tricky for people living with affective and mood disorders. For example, trying to socialize in a manic state often leads to serious social consequences. During mania, people may appear elated, sharing grandiose ideas and speaking rapidly, all while trying to keep up with their thoughts, most of which seem more brilliant than the next.I have experienced this first-hand. I have also observed it with friends battling mood disorders; I know how difficult it is to maintain healthy connections with friends. When friends fixate on your welfare out of concern for your well-being, they spend more time watching over you than connecting with you in a meaningful way. Support from peers becomes tricky when mutual support takes a back seat to a friend in the throes of mania.Scholars must research how specific mental health symptoms can be alleviated by social interactions, kinship networks, family support and other socialized mediums enriching our lives and offering conditions supporting a healthy lifestyle. Perhaps the social landscape can be mapped out charted, and better understood by researchers evaluating support and the prognosis of people with severe mental health conditions.In doing so, research can offer clinicians working with people with severe mental health conditions recommendations and other suggestions on re-working and re-patterning their social world to best promote a healthy space for their recovery. Additionally, clinicians might be able to identify and mark protective factors more quickly and leave their patients or peers in a better position when they regain their independence.The mental health system speaks so fondly of socialization, but currently, it does little to support those engaged in the process.This is a problem for everyone involved in the recovery process. Clinicians need to provide psychoeducation to the friends and relatives of those with a diagnosis, not just the patient, to honestly expect results that will have a lasting impact on the life of those in recovery. Friends, relatives and other social connections without psychoeducation, even with good intentions, can negatively impact the recovery process or put the diagnosed person at risk of relapse or worsening symptoms. Providing recovery-focused attitudes about what to expect from someone with a specific diagnosis regarding their capacity to socialize and access social support is even more critical.Socializing is a skill set that's multifaceted and not quite as simple as telling someone to \"make a friend.\" We must teach realistic expectations and skillsets targeting specific disorders and courses of treatment to improve outcomes. Preparing all support systems with an accurate clinical picture might make the difference for those trying to move forward in their recovery.Max E.

      "body": "When I first taught NAMI’s Family-to-Family course in 2014, my co-teacher (who was a 25-year NAMI state leader and classroom teacher) introduced me to a word I’d never heard of: anosognosia. When she defined anosognosia to us, I had a revelation so powerful it practically knocked me out of my chair. The basic definition: A symptom experienced by those with serious mental illness (SMI) in which a person cannot recognize that they have a mental illness.For me, learning this term was a game-changer. I had experienced this in my own family and had been asked by others, “Why can’t my loved one believe me and their doctors and just do the right thing — take their meds, go to therapy and get better? Why can’t they see how odd their behavior is? Why do they refuse help?”I had wondered this myself. My co-teacher told us about Dr. Xavier Amador and his ground-breaking book, “I’m Not Sick, I Don’t Need Help!” I read it, and my perspective changed forever.As a peer — someone with depression, from a family with a history of depression and anxiety disorders — I have nothing medical or deeply profound to add to the body of work on the subject of anosognosia. Except this: I am convinced that a broad familiarity within our society about this condition would be life-changing for people with SMI and their families. Awareness, I believe, would encourage people to offer empathy for those struggling with SMI, as opposed to the contempt or disgust many seem to exhibit.The percentages of those with SMIs who experience anosognosia are high: 40% with bipolar disorder and, by some estimates, as high as 98% of those with a diagnosis of schizophrenia.SMIs like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have their origins in a dysfunction of the frontal lobe. This is significant, as the frontal lobe is the seat of organization (or executive function) and, more importantly, self-image and self-reflection. Damage to or chemical dysfunction in the frontal lobe prevents our brains from updating our images of ourselves. Objectivity is nearly impossible, and we are unable to view our words and behavior in relation to others. The word anosognosia is actually of Greek origin, meaning without knowledge of disease or, more broadly, lack of insight.One of the most confounding aspects of anosognosia is that the degree of the lack of insight varies from person to person as well as day to day; this can result in your loved one having some level of recognition of their illness on Tuesday and zero recognition on Thursday. Hence, this hampers our ability to get them to see their doctors or therapists or take their meds as prescribed with regularity. We might see an uptick in their mental health and behavior one week, only to see them “slip back” the next.I have heard participants in more than one of my NAMI Family-to-Family classes say that their loved one is in denial about their mental illness. I always encourage people to reframe this kind of thinking. Their loved one is not “in denial.” And they’re not mean, stubborn, self-centered, or lazy. Absolutely not. One man even said he thought his son enjoyed his mental health condition because he had an excuse to stay broken and do nothing. As someone with a mental health disorder and with a grandparent, parent, and child with mental health challenges, I cannot believe that anyone would choose to stay untreated with their SMI. Let’s bring it back to anosognosia.While an understanding of anosognosia is imperative to how we view and treat someone with a serious mental illness, the flip side is a sense of enlightenment for family and caregivers, as well. There’s no need to argue or fight, as you remind yourself that this will accomplish nothing but escalate tension and animosity. Anger does not diminish the effects of anosognosia. Nor does logic. As you can’t squeeze water from a rock, you can’t force insight onto a person experiencing anosognosia.But you can benefit from insight. Self-care is an essential part of life with a family member with SMI. Save the energy you invested in arguing with your loved one and channel it into self-kindness. NAMI reminds us:Give yourself a break from the frustration and disappointment of your inability to communicate with your loved one about their illness.When I talk with someone about a loved one with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, I always ask if they are familiar with anosognosia. Sadly, all of the people I have asked have replied, “no.” The look of revelation, compassion and empathy on their faces after an explanation is a rewarding moment for me every time.This has led me to wonder: Why aren’t practitioners explaining anosognosia to families? How much kinder, more compassionate and more patient would we be with our loved ones if we understood that their brains can't process the fact that their perception doesn’t reflect reality?So if someone in your family — or even a close friend, neighbor, or co-worker — has a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, openly discuss anosognosia with them, if they are comfortable. In fact, discuss it with anyone when the subject of mental illness comes up in conversation. Talk about it with someone whose loved one is non-compliant with their medication regimen or is refusing entry into a treatment facility. An understanding that the person is not in denial, stubborn or apathetic about their circumstances can lift a heavy weight off their shoulders. Use your personal skills and strengths to broaden awareness and generate compassion for those who, through no fault of their own, run from the outstretched hand of help.As I address in the book I co-wrote with Dr. Terri Lyon, “Make a Difference with Mental Health Activism,” we can’t underestimate the wide-reaching impacts of personal activism, particularly in areas of mental health. Activism boosts emotional well-being and is a critical step toward ending stigma, achieving parity and increasing mental health services and support.

      "body": "Recently, I wrote a book about the challenges and stresses of mothering adult children. I began my research in senior centers in the New York City area and gave members of these centers a short talk about my project. I asked who in the audience was a parent — and I inquired about the parenting problems they encountered when their children were one year old, three years old and 15 years old. The audience laughed and shouted out various issues like teething and sleep (for babies and toddlers) and drugs or problems in school (for adolescents).I then asked what kinds of problems their 30 or 40-year-old kids faced. The audience became silent. One or two said “depression,” “drug problems” and “unemployment.” I then explained that I was doing a research study that hoped to understand the kinds of problems mothers have experienced with their adult children. At each site, a few women came forward. I arranged a time to interview them privately.All the women in my study were over 55 years old. I purposely included women who were from all income groups (low-income, middle-class and affluent) and lived in in various parts of the country. I met with each woman two times, conducting in-depth interviews. My focus was on what issues had emerged in their adult child’s life and how these problems had affected them. I quickly realized that these mothers’ experiences and challenges centered around caring for their children who developed serious mental illness (SMI) in adulthood.I learned that the women were dealing with more than one problem. For example, Durene, who was 72 years old, told me about her son’s mental health diagnosis 17 years ago. He had gone off to college, but in his second year, he experienced a psychotic episode. Durene had to bring him home from school — and he has been living with her since. She described how life is a strain on a daily basis. He’s “selfish,” she said, and they have fights over keeping the kitchen clean.On two occasions, her son pulled a knife on her, and she called the police. Her friends advised her to “put him out.” But she told me that she was not going to listen to them. She feared more for her son’s safety. “He will not survive; he will not survive,” she repeated. Durene firmly believed that if she followed her friends’ advice and evicted her son from her home, he would not be able to live on the streets of New York City, homeless.A main theme that I heard expressed was the women’s sense of shame and self-blame for their adult children’s problems. “I was a working mother.” “My husband was abusive, and they witnessed that.” “I was a single mom.” And this shame may explain why many of them were living in secret, afraid to share even with family the problems they were having in their own homes with their now adult children. They felt alone and increasingly isolated.Even though I had not set out to study mothers whose adult children had serious mental illness, to my surprise, nearly all the research subjects’ adult children had problems with serious mental illness and/or substance use disorders. Their children had all returned home because they could no longer work and had no place to live. Each of the women re-opened their homes. A few had sufficient resources to house them in a separate residence. Many had situations like Durene’s, in which they felt their space was being invaded, and they did not know who to turn to for assistance. “If not me, who?” was what I heard from so many about their feelings of responsibility regarding their adult children’s safety.Another woman I interviewed, Jillian, described that she felt like a mule, attached to a cart, and she couldn’t disconnect. The cart was her daughter’s illness and the need to make sure her child had a place to live and food to eat. Jillian had moved her daughter 21 times in 20 years. As a result of the stress, she hated each time the phone rang, fearing it was the police or the landlord. She developed ulcers and described feeling like she was “bleeding inside.”Through these interviews, I learned just how much the women’s decision-making was influenced by a deep internalized wish to be “a good mother.” When women were faced with calling the police or evicting their adult children who were putting their lives at risk, so many told me in different words, “That is not what a mother does.” These mothers wanted their adult children to get help — not to go to jail or be homeless. They felt trapped by the lack of available help and by their inability to turn away from their role as a mother, despite their own advanced years.When I started interviewing moms who had been through the NAMI Family-to-Family Program, I heard much less self-blame. Each of the NAMI mothers described an enormous feeling of relief after attending their first NAMI group; suddenly, they no longer felt alone. Learning about their adult child’s situation as an illness or serious medical condition allowed them to see that they were not necessarily the “cause” of their children’s mental illness and resulting challenges.The NAMI Family-to-Family program also offered avenues for women to feel empowered to use their energy to help others. Leslie Carpenter, who is now a full-time advocate for people with mental illness, told me, “The whole thing NAMI program really helped me to move from hiding, crying and being angry to speaking out.”My three-part book delves into the mothers’ stories, hopes for the future and ways to seek support (through NAMI or Al-Anon groups). Thank you to NAMI moms for providing these models of hope.Judith R.

      "body": "25 years ago, I packed my two young children and cedar chest into the back of my truck. We were westbound from Colorado Springs to Medford, Oregon, looking for a new life away from abuse. We started over in the safety of a duplex behind my brother’s house. He and my sister-in-law had secured the nice, humble home for us while I was still making my escape plans on the other side of the Rockies.I had the perfect job transfer working for Mayflower transit. My daughter was enrolled in the same school I went to at her age and my son went to a good daycare. Things seemed like they were all going to work out, and we would have the perfect American dream, if just I worked hard enough.One morning, my brother called and told me that my beloved grandfather had suffered a heart attack. I remember falling to my knees and screaming. The strawberry cake I had been frosting for my daughter’s second grade class fell to the floor, coming apart all over the tiles. It seemed like a metaphor for my crumbling life.This was the last traumatic event in my life that my mind could handle, and it marked the beginning of my first bipolar episode. It would not be my last, by far. I was diagnosed with PTSD and Bipolar I at the age of 30. I thought I had escaped my marriage with my sanity, but at that point, my sanity felt so far gone.It wasn’t long after the funeral that I was admitted to the hospital. I was traumatized and manic —and I began experiencing psychosis.My family tried to help with the children, and my mother even flew out from Arizona to stay with them for the first month that I was in and out of the hospital. She took care of me after I was released, which was no small task. I was so thin. I remember her making me peanut butter milkshakes to eat with my morning pills.I soon spiraled into another mania despite all my mother’s heroic attempts to save me.I remember galloping my horse Nick down the road, dodging traffic and yelling at the top of my lungs. I believed the whole world was watching me, as if I were on a live broadcast. By this time, my mother needed to go back to Arizona. She could not handle my manic energy any longer — it became too much to manage in addition to caring for my precious children, who were now scared to death. They had never known me not to protect them.I tried so hard to take care of my kids with other family support. My younger brother stepped in and had me readmitted to a mental health facility. He was able to convince me to hand over my babies to my other brother and sister-in-law, promising they would be fine.When I left to be hospitalized, my son, who was only a toddler at the time, was terrified. My daughter was stood nearby, sobbing. My heart was so broken.I remember the drive to the hospital. I panicked and tried to jump out of my brother’s Volkswagen van. He quickly reached over and shut the passenger door. I punched him in the jaw with a solid right. But somehow, he managed to coax me into the emergency room again.At this point, I was hallucinating and so scared that I had to be put in restraints. I was immediately taken to the psychiatric ward. I was held in solitary confinement with a big metal door locked behind me. The windowless room felt like a cold dungeon.When I woke up in the morning after being tranquilized so heavily, all I could think about was my children, and how they must be needing me right now. Even though I knew my family had stepped in to care for them, I could only think of them wondering where their mother was, especially after the unsettling drama the night before.I remained manic for several days in the hospital. Once they let me out of solitary confinement, I was introduced to the community group room, where I very slowly adapted to stimuli again. I remember only being allowed to sit by the fish tank. I would watch a bug-eyed black fish for a while and feel some level of relaxation before being brought back to my little quarantine room below. I could not handle too much activity at this time in my treatment program; I was extremely sensitive and fragile. I finally stabilized enough to go home.After the manic phase, and my release from the hospital, came a wave of depression. There are no words to describe the depth of despair I plunged into. One day, I knocked out half the power of Medford by ramming my truck into a utility pole. Transformers crashed down all around my truck. Later that day, I made an attempt on my life, leaving scars behind.Following this series of events, my children went back to their father’s home in Colorado, as he was able to prove I was not fit to care for them. My children struggled to adapt to their new situation for much of their childhoods.My mental health journey has been a scary and challenging road for my family, especially my children. They are scarred but resilient. I’m so grateful for them. They have been so forgiving of both their father and me.Ultimately, I’ve learned that hope walks with the hurting. I held onto my faith, and I spent a lot of time praying, with tears flowing down my face. Despite the ups and downs, I am determined to survive the coming storms.Randi Barnum is an enthusiast of life and all that may come with it.

      "body": "“Find something to represent her and put an item in your office so that she feels accepted,” My therapist said. She shared this advice with me while I was working on healing from dissociative identity disorder (DID) formerly known as multiple personality disorder. The “she” my therapist was referring to was one of my altered states (also known as alters/parts).I could not believe that this had become my life — talking to my therapist about my different alters/parts and ways to help them, love them, learn about them, write to them and attune to their needs. It was like taking care of a large family inside myself. It was the ultimate lesson in parenting, the reparenting of myself, all of me. It was also exhausting, sad, irritating, disappointing and incredibly painful.Though the journey has not been easy, having reached a solid understanding of who I am in addition to coming forward with my lived experience has brought me a profound sense of peace and emotional freedom.It was a costly journey — both financially and emotionally — and absolutely worth every dollar spent and every tear shed.Now, I’m hoping to give back by sharing my experience and helping others in their recovery.There were times I thought about giving up on my healing journey, but my heart knew that I could not. So I put one foot in front of the other, took things one day at a time and held on tightly to myself and to my faith.For me, coping meant keeping up with therapy, consulting with my mentors and attending trauma-healing intensive workshops, soul workshops, women's groups and bodywork. It meant letting my husband show up for all parts of me and asking for help, encouragement and support as I navigated the healing journey. It required building a network of healers and strengthening my internal and external resources as I leaned in and surrendered to fully trusting the process.The healing process presented many challenges, like getting to a place of loving all my identities and accepting that they were all me. It also required fully confronting my past. When I was able to accept what happened to me, the diagnosis itself and the impact DID has had on my life and relationships — things started to change. I allowed myself time to grieve the reality of my childhood and finally let out my tears and feelings. It was a process and the transformation did not happen overnight.After years of effort, I reached a place of internal trust and cooperation. I was ready to live. I was happy, healthy, connected, loved and respected. Most importantly, I loved and respected myself.I never intended to speak about my lived experience. I had never even planned to disclose my diagnosis to any family or friends. My plan was simply to heal and forget about it. But then I found my voice and began to embrace my experience and diagnosis.I wanted to encourage others to keep going, to hold on, to work toward recovery and to have hope. My purpose became clear: I wanted to help others. I wanted to work serve my community through public advocacy, speaking, educating, consulting, writing and my work as a psychologist because I could understand the perspective of both therapist and client. Through this work, I hoped to change how DID is perceived.I respect that a public disclosure of a highly stigmatized and debated condition like DID is not for everyone, nor is it always safe depending on a person’s circumstances. For me, it required deep thought, consideration, time, consultation and a solid place in my recovery.For those who have reached a point in their recovery where they can tell their story in a safe and empowering way, I recommend taking time to share your experience with others.I want my story to change the negative and inaccurate narratives surrounding this mental health condition and to instill a sense of hope.A diagnosis does not define me, nor does it define anyone else. I am a human being who has endured extreme trauma. I am no monster, and I am not dangerous. My favorite cartoon as a little girl was Care Bears, and I can tell you with certainty that I am a cheerful person with a tender heart. I want the best for people. I genuinely believe others deserve to love themselves and to get to a place of self-love and self-acceptance.As Brenè Brown says, and one of my therapists used to reiterate to me all the time, “Love will never be certain, but after collecting thousands of stories, I am willing to call this a fact: A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all men, women and children. We are biologically, cognitively, physically and spiritually wired to love, to be loved and to belong.”I have come to view having DID as a gift. I would not have survived without it. Of course, I made mistakes. I let people down. I missed a lot. The journey to get here was not perfect and recovery was not and will never be perfect. Healing will be lifelong, because as a human being I am constantly growing, adapting and learning. But this process has taught me that I wanted more for myself and for others than to just live-in survival mode. I wanted to thrive.“I believe we are here on the planet Earth to live, grow up and do what we can to make this world a better place for all people to enjoy freedom.” – Rosa ParksAdrian Fletcher, Psy.D. is a human first, therapist second.

      "body": "An estimated 7 million adults in the U.S. live with bipolar disorder, a mental health condition that causes dramatic shifts in a person’s mood, energy and ability to think clearly. Its effects can be disabling; an estimated 83% of people with bipolar disorder had serious impairment, the highest rate among mood disorders. Bipolar disorder is also highly stigmatized, resulting in the spread of misinformation and misconceptions about the condition.On my journey to recovery from bipolar disorder, I have encountered the condition’s challenges, as well as society’s misperceptions. I have encountered people who believe that all that people with bipolar disorder enjoy manic episodes. I have seen other people who believed mania was an amusing spectacle; instead of helping people during a manic episode, they might stare or laugh, even encouraging the dangerous behaviors. And I have experienced just how harmful the manic and depressive episodes can be.But I have also learned that it is possible to live in recovery. And, with the right information, we can fight the stigma and help the people we know who live with bipolar disorder.There are several types of bipolar disorder to be aware of. Bipolar I and II are the most common types; People with bipolar I experience mania while people with bipolar II experience a milder form of mania called hypomania. Less common is schizoaffective disorder bipolar type, which is, as the name suggests, a combination of schizophrenia and bipolar. This comorbidity (the presence of two conditions) is common with bipolar disorder. Over 50% of people with bipolar I and II experience anxiety, and 48% and 61% engage in substance use, respectively. Often, people will choose to self-medicate with substance use — and this can trigger other symptoms.For bipolar I and II, people experience phases of illness; the main phases are the highs of hypomania/mania and the lows of major depression.Some common symptoms of hypomania/mania include inflated self-esteem, decreased need for sleep, increased talkativeness and goal-directed activity, racing thoughts and engaging in activities with potentially damaging consequences. Hypomania may not appear to interfere with everyday functioning, and some people may even enjoy being hypomanic, so they may resist treatment during this phase. But both forms of mania can have serious consequences. In addition to hospitalizations, criminal offending and arrests, this symptom can significantly harm people and their relationships.It’s also important to be able to identify a depressive episode; common symptoms of depression for people with bipolar I and II include low mood, loss of interest in activities, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, difficulty thinking or concentrating and recurrent suicidal ideation.Some people may also experience a “mixed state” that combines the features of mania and depression.Approximately 53% of people with bipolar I can experience psychosis, in which a person loses touch with reality, often experiencing hallucinations and delusions. An estimated 40% of people with bipolar experience anosognosia or lack of awareness of symptoms. People with bipolar disorder also face high rates of suicide that exceed those of other major psychiatric disorders — up to 19% die by suicide and up to 50% will make a non-fatal suicide attempt.When learning about bipolar disorder, it’s important to understand the basics.Risk Factors: Having a close relative with bipolar disorder, experiencing stressful life events and having a history of substance abuse are all risk factors for bipolar disorder.Onset: The average age of onset is 25 years old, but symptoms also appear in the teen years.Diagnosis: To be diagnosed with bipolar disorder, a person must have experienced at least one episode of hypomania/mania. Getting a correct diagnosis can take time. Many with bipolar are misdiagnosed with either unipolar depression, which often precedes a manic episode, schizophrenia if the person experiences psychosis or borderline personality disorder if they experience rapid mood cycling.Treatment: It is important for those experiencing symptoms of bipolar disorder to receive a diagnosis and treatment as soon as possible. Without it, the condition may worsen and become harder to treat. Some people are initially prescribed anti-depressants for unipolar depression, which have not been shown effective to treat bipolar depression and may trigger a manic episode. Further, substance use may complicate the treatment of bipolar disorder.Medication: There are many medication options for treating bipolar disorder. Typically, patients are prescribed lithium and some anticonvulsants, which can help stabilize mood. They may also be given antipsychotics that mostly treat mania (although few treat depression as well). Antidepressants are also included in many courses of treatment. It is important to ask about common side effects before taking a medication; side effects are a common reason for non-adherence to a medication regimen, which is the leading risk of relapse.Therapy: Effective types of therapy include Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Family-Focused Therapy (FFT) and Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT). CBT seeks to change thinking and behavioral patterns that target problem areas. FFT involves psychoeducation, communication enhancement training and problem-solving skills training. IPSRT helps people improve medication adherence, manage stressful life events and reduce disruptions in “social rhythms” or patterns of daily habits.While bipolar disorder can be incredibly harmful if untreated, it can also be accompanied by “positive” attributes, which are a source of pride for many people.A leading bipolar scholar identified numerous extremely well-known poets, writers, composers and painters who lived or are living with bipolar disorder, including Vincent Van Gogh, Virginia Woolf and Ernest Hemingway. In her 1996 book “Touched with Fire,” she argues that the instability of mood and temperament characteristic of bipolar are integral to their productivity and originality.People with bipolar disorder are also over-represented among highly successful entrepreneurs. The symptoms and traits of bipolar have been associated with high IQ and perseverance on difficult tasks. Other positive attributes exhibited during a hypomanic state, which may favor entrepreneurial activities,  include high energy levels, extroversion, self-esteem and optimism.Ultimately, bipolar disorder is complex. It is not easy to treat, nor is it easy to live with. In fact, it may take many years to learn how to manage it, as it did for me. I reached recovery thanks to great treatment and a supportive family, but most of all because of me. Once I realized that I could manage my symptoms, I took responsibility for my illness and did everything I could to get and stay well.I would like to thank Dr. Joseph Goldberg, a leading mood disorders psychiatrist specializing in bipolar, for being my wonderful doctor and for taking the time to review this blog post.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder after first being diagnosed over 20 years ago.

      "body": "When I was in my teens, I started experiencing symptoms of depression. Unfortunately, my family didn’t know much about mental illness or what symptoms to look for. So, every time I couldn’t get out of bed – sometimes for days or longer – they’d say, “looks like Barb has mono again!”Only after a major episode in my freshman year of college did I seek and get the help I needed. I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, began therapy and started a medication to help my symptoms. For so many reasons, this was a relief. Not only was I starting to feel better, but I had a name to put to what was happening to me.Over the next few years, I got used to my condition and became more and more open about it. The world was changing when it came to talking about mental health — and talking about having depression, going to therapy ­­and taking medication wasn’t a big deal to me.When I was 22, things changed. One day, I woke up with more energy than I’d ever had. I went to work, but couldn’t sit still, and I left at lunch. I felt an uncontrollable need to keep moving, and the first thing I did was go shopping. I grabbed clothes I’d never normally wear — or afford — and impulsively bought them. Then, I had the thought that I really needed to plant a garden in my front lawn, so immediately went and bought a carload of flowers and soil and ran back home to plant.I spent hours doing this, without regard to anything else — work, food, my roommate. I was simply no longer in control of my body. The next couple of days, I continued this trend. I didn’t sleep much, I talked nonstop, I cleaned our apartment obsessively. Finally, I crashed hard, falling into a deep depression that prompted me to call my psychiatrist at the time.After I explained what had happened, she told me it sounded like a hypomanic episode, potentially a sign of bipolar disorder type II, and she recommended I try a new medication. For some reason, this diagnosis was a heck of a lot scarier than my depression diagnosis. This one made me feel like I was “crazy.” Movies and other media often show people with bipolar disorder as unpredictable, even dangerous. I, on the other hand, felt I “had things together.” I had a great job, was in a loving relationship, got along great with my friends. And I certainly didn’t feel dangerous.Over time, I learned more about bipolar, what it was and wasn’t, how I could live well with it. And I trusted my doctor and therapist, who both helped me learn to cope with new symptoms. I still “had it together.” However, whenever I shared that I had a mental health condition with another person, I was truthful about depression, but I conveniently did not mention the bipolar II. And things went well, for a while.Unfortunately, my symptoms came back, and I had another hypomanic episode. My doctor and I discussed how there might be other kinds of medications that could help me. I was open to it. But when I looked up my new medication, I learned it was classified as an “antipsychotic.” What? I thought. Was I now a villain in a scary movie? While I did not actually experience psychosis, the medication happens to work for other symptoms I was experiencing as well. So, I decided to take it — and it really, really helped.But like so many other people, I was spooked by the label. I repeatedly tried to stop taking the medication (with my doctor’s knowledge but against his advice) and each time the depression piece of my bipolar II came back with a vengeance. Finally, I acknowledged that the medication was the right thing for me.Stigma is powerful, so powerful that it made me fall into multiple, avoidable depressions. So powerful that I was ashamed to tell my partner or family what medications I took. I believe that words matter, and I think many people, at least in my community, are ready to hear the words “anti-depressant” or “anti-anxiety.” But “antipsychotic” smacked a label on me that, unfortunately, is not universally accepted yet.It was only with knowledge that I became more comfortable with both my condition and my treatment. I occasionally started mentioning that I had bipolar II with some of my friends when I was struggling, some of whom were curious about the condition, but all of whom were supportive. But it took me a lot longer before I could start sharing that I took an antipsychotic medication to treat it, and to this day I wonder if it frightens people when I tell them.I know that the more I share, the more I demonstrate that it’s ok to have a serious mental health condition, the better the process will be for the next person diagnosed with this common, treatable condition. While I no longer take the antipsychotic for other medical reasons, I have learned through the process not to let a label define me. If you’re experiencing something like this, I hope you won’t let it define you, either.Barb Solish is the Director of NAMI’s Youth and Young Adult Initiatives.

      "body": "Those of us who have experienced psychosis will tell you: we can be overly hard on ourselves after an episode. After a mental health crisis, it can be easy to blame yourself and lose yourself in shame. But over time, I’ve learned that self-blame isn’t the answer — self-love is. Choosing to love yourself can serve as a road map out of darkness and into a bright future.My journey to healing was a long one. After each hospitalization for psychosis, I woke up every morning feeling defeated and like my life was over — or it should have been. I had no assurance — no confirmation — that my life as I knew it would ever return and move forward. I just had to force myself to put one foot in front of the other, believing it was possible for me to heal.My mental health journey would have been much easier if I had been able to see my future; to know that my life would turn around and that I would secure a full-time job, and, a year later, I would land a career position. It would have been all the motivation in the world to already know that in five years I would marry the wonderful man I love in the presence of family members who stuck by me and good friends, some old and some new. It would have been pure joy to know that in seven years I would give birth and become a mother.However, we do not get to glimpse our futures. And in those early months and years, all I could see in front of me were disability papers, medication and a diagnosis, not to mention debilitating emotional pain and cognitive damage. During my hospitalizations, I often felt like the mountain before me was too formidable to climb. But something in me wouldn’t allow me to give up — and I’m thankful for that. My favorite quote by Dr. Martin Luther King is, “Faith is taking the first step even when you can’t see the whole staircase.”I had to trust I was moving in the right direction without having everything figured out. But to take those first steps, I had to believe that I was still alive for a reason. I had to know that I matter. I had to love myself enough to want good things to happen in my life.Loving yourself can take many forms: The initiative to first seek treatment and then the persistence to stick with it. The tenacity to find the answers you are looking for and find the right doctor. The infinite patience you must have while your brain heals. The ability to realize that your illness is a medical condition, not a character flaw. The grace to know that you can still enjoy life even if you are not completely healed yet, and the faith that one day you will be. The confidence to accept you may need to take medication for life. The boldness to make the best decisions for you, no matter what anyone else thinks about mental illness. The recognition, acceptance and appreciation of moments when others love you, and are cheering you on, because feeling loved and supported also helps so much with having the motivation and courage to recover.You can still have love for yourself, even if you have competing feelings like shame, anger and sadness. Even though it has been 10 years since my last psychotic break, I still blame and shame myself sometimes for having had psychosis, as part of a mental health diagnosis so stigmatized by society. I struggle sometimes with being kind and forgiving to myself, even though I know I did nothing wrong by having mental illness.It would be so misleading to state that any of this is easy. Coming to terms with how I feel about what I went through is still an ongoing battle for me, but I’m winning because love always seems to win in the end. I have found this to be true in my story, and I think love can win in your life too.I once thought that the worst thing in the world was to lose your mind, but it isn’t. The condition of your heart matters more. The ability to choose love is the one thing that can never be taken away from you.Sarah Ryan is a writer covering mental illness topics like stigma, recovery and hope.

      "body": "I was scrolling through TikTok the other night, as many Gen Z-ers do, and I came across a woman my age talking about trigger warnings. For those unfamiliar, Merriam-Webster defines a “trigger warning” as “a statement of caution that content may be disturbing or upsetting.” This woman was mocking those providing trigger warnings before their videos, arguing that trigger warnings are useless, that the world cannot and will not “shelter you,” and that the only one who cares about what you are going through is yourself.I found this message to be incredibly toxic and harmful. As someone with mental illness, I was upset to see someone with an online platform telling her audience that “no one cares.” As many of us living with mental health conditions will tell you, mental illness often tells us just that; that we are worthless, alone and a burden.Although I struggle with my mental health, I am fortunate to have resources and a support system to turn to. Not everyone does. And not everyone viewing this woman’s video will question her thinking. Instead, they will internalize her words and believe they cannot turn to anyone. Often, those living with mental illness will suffer alone to avoid burdening others. While a friend cannot provide the same level of support as a mental health professional, they can remind you that you are loved, you are worthy and you matter.When people with influence demean trigger warnings, they perpetuate a harmful line of thinking that ignores the lived experiences of so many people.Trigger warnings have been a topic of debate for years. They are a controversial subject, especially in the academic sphere. Professors and teachers have largely adopted disclaimer language, providing warnings of the content discussed in semesters on their syllabuses or before classes. In my senior year of college, my creative writing professor required my classmates and I to put trigger warnings before our short stories if the work discussed traumatic events. Similarly, mental health events I have attended included resources and a disclaimer at the beginning that difficult subjects may arise.Those against trigger warnings argue that they are coddling people and simply don’t help. Or, like this woman on TikTok, they might say that that trigger warnings are making the younger generation too sensitive. However, there isn’t enough data to conclude whether these disclaimers do or don’t work yet. But, regardless of efficacy, is that the point? Perhaps we could see trigger warnings as giving students or individuals the choice to decide for themselves what they can handle.Certainly, this TikTokker isn’t completely wrong. Society does not always care. The world can be a hard place, and mental illness is still very much stigmatized. I do not expect the world to “baby” me, but is that what trigger warnings are about? I don’t believe so.When a social media influencer or professor or a television show alerts me: “trigger warning,” I feel respected. I feel seen; as if someone is telling me, “I know what you have been through, and it is ok if right now you do not want to go back there.”Trigger warnings give people autonomy. They allow people to compose themselves, to enter a healthier mindset or simply to decide, “I cannot handle this today.” After all, trauma is very real — and people’s  reactions to their life experiences are valid and do not require the approval of other people. Trigger warnings, as I understand them, are an act of compassion, not a sign of a weak generation. Because one of the strongest things you can do is ask for help or admit, “I am not ok.” Trigger warnings say, “Not everyone will care, but I do. I care.”Meghan Nelligan is a creative writer and mental health advocate based in New Jersey.

      "body": "Far too many film depictions of mental health facilities suggest that inpatient stays are terrifying or abusive. As you may recall from the 1975 movie \"One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest,\" a practitioner performs lobotomies on patients.While these negative depictions may have been more realistic in the past, they do not reflect the current experience of an inpatient stay at a mental health facility.Given these negative depictions, I was nervous when I was admitted to inpatient care. I had no idea what to expect, and I feared for the worst. For anyone who may be considering an inpatient stay, I want to share what I’ve learned about the process in hopes of giving you the information I once needed.The facility where you receive treatment may not be the one closest to where you live. Initially, I couldn't understand why I went into an inpatient treatment center so far from home. However, when I began to work at emergency services, and was the one tasked with calling for open beds for patients, I came to understand how the system works.Treatment location often comes down to availability, which can be very limited. Therefore, we can't pick our inpatient stays like we would a hotel, and it might not be the most convenient. With that said, it's important to remember that what matters most is receiving proper treatment and getting healthy.During the intake process, you will likely meet several providers, including a therapist/social worker, psychiatrist and nurses. These providers will walk you through the following steps:Throughout your stay, you will have a therapist (or social worker) and psychiatrist assigned to work with you. Keep in mind that if you have been admitted during the weekend or on holidays, you will be given a temporary psychiatrist and may not see your therapist until a regular workday.More often than not, you will share a room with another individual. Most inpatient centers don't have many single rooms, which can feel uncomfortable for some. However, many enjoy the company and conversation with peers.It’s usually best to avoid isolating yourself in your room, but, of course, the room can also be a haven when you need space, time for yourself and quiet. Even if you do have a roommate, you will likely have some time alone in your room.Mental health counselors often do a frequent headcount to ensure everyone's location and safety throughout the day. Staff will continue this process throughout the night. Naturally, you may not be thrilled about this frequent monitoring — but try to remember that your providers are simply looking out for you in the best way they can.All inpatient centers run differently, but they do have set regimens.Inpatient stays do not look like the hospitalizations of decades past, where individuals stayed for months or years. Historically, mental health resources were not available in the “outside world,” so individuals were either hospitalized for long periods or released to fend for themselves. However, in the current mental health landscape, we have more resources than ever before. As a result, inpatient stays are typically short-lived, and patients receive follow-up outpatient care.Unfortunately, due to the volume of patients, the treatment teams at inpatient facilities do not have the time that a personal therapist or psychiatrist has with each patient. This coupled with the fact that insurance companies cover a limited stay per client, means that you will be encouraged to move to outpatient care quickly.Accordingly, your therapist may prioritize case management rather than counseling, and they will find the appropriate services for you, like an outside therapist or prescriber if you don't have one. They might also recommend a partial-hospitalization, a day group program that teaches coping skills and can last between days to several weeks. Inpatient psychiatrists also have a minimal time window, so they will likely prioritize immediate stabilization over creating a long-term treatment regimen to ensure you are safe before discharge.Of course, being hospitalized may not sound ideal. And it certainly isn’t a fun vacation. But it can be a life-saving and enriching experience. Inpatient care can help stabilize you and provide you with resources you might not have known about. Ultimately, this kind of care saved my life. And I hope for others to have a similar experience.Sandy Glover is a mental health advocate with degrees in psychology and mental health counseling.

      "body": "Growing up, I was a studious, perfectionist go-getter. Even in my earliest memories, I was focused on getting the perfect grades, behaving perfectly and even eating perfectly. I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do with my life, but I reasoned that all I had to do was focus on getting into a good college with a scholarship — and then my life would unfold without too many hiccups.That was my approach for the first eighteen years of my life. I managed to get a college scholarship in seventh grade, I took all of the AP classes my school offered, I played sports, ran clubs, volunteered and became valedictorian of my high school. I got into an “elite” private college with everything paid for. I figured I was set.Soon everything collapsed.In my second semester of college, I experienced a manic episode and psychosis with no warning or apparent cause. For a week, I slept for half an hour each night. I barely ate. I spent all my time working on my art (I was a fine arts major focusing on traditional printmaking). I began to think I could fly and was close to seriously injuring myself multiple times. My mind raced constantly, and my body never seemed to slow down. Worst of all, I had no awareness of anything being amiss. I didn’t question whether anything was “off.” I didn’t know that my life was about to change.What comes up must come down. I slept for 22 hours straight and woke up feeling depressed and suicidal. I started planning my death. Thankfully, I managed to ask for help. I went to the college’s counseling center and spoke up. After my confession, I found myself in the psychiatric hospital, where I stayed for a few months.While in treatment, I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder (bipolar type). Ultimately, I experience depression, mania, delusions and auditory hallucinations.In the decade since that diagnosis, I’ve spent my time trying to get well. It has been an unpredictable journey, with plenty of setbacks. Hospitalizations. Suicide attempts. Medication changes. Psychotic episodes. Sexual assault. Therapists. Doctors. Electroconvulsive shock therapy. Chronic illness. Life.For each of these setbacks, I’ve also made progress in my recovery and come to understand the complex reality of adulthood.Often, I reminisce on what it was like to feel mentally “healthy” — the way I was during my childhood. It’s become almost impossible for me to remember clearly, but I dream of it, and I crave it. I wonder where I’d be now if I didn’t have this illness. I wonder if I’d have a degree, a steady job, my own home and the courage to drive a car. I think about how I could have missed all the traumatic experiences I had in the hospitals: involuntary stays, sexual assault, loss of privacy, loss of contact with the outside world.Sometimes, I think back and remember how easy everyday things used to be — and it’s heartbreaking. I know my illness isn’t my fault (and that it runs in my family) but sometimes I wonder if I could go back in time and prevent it. But I also wonder if I would actually make that choice. I am not my mental illness — but it has certainly carved me out. My mental health condition has affected every aspect of my life any many aspects of my family and friends’ lives. It has informed who I am today and who I’ll be tomorrow.It’s easy to say, “you shouldn't have regrets” or, “your struggles have made you stronger.” But it’s also ok to grieve the life you thought you’d live.It’s ok to grieve the dreams that didn’t become reality. It’s ok to grieve the achievements that weren’t awarded. It’s ok to grieve the happiness, peace and stability that you have desperately sought out. It’s ok to grieve the money you spent. It’s ok to grieve while thinking back to the impulsive or embarrassing decisions you made when you weren’t yourself. It’s ok to grieve knowing your struggles may have taken things away from you.I’m allowing myself to grieve these things. I’m trying to be easier on myself — to fight my perfectionism and the voice in the back of my mind that says that my illnesses are stopping me from doing all the things I desire.I’m finally allowing myself to be proud of the small things I manage on the roughest of days. I’m allowing myself to be proud of the days when I push thoughts of self-harm away. For when I speak up and share my struggles. For when I call my therapist instead of hiding away from the world. When I simply get out of bed.I think we all could use a little more self-compassion, couldn’t we?Josey is a professional oil painter and printmaker, a yoga teacher and an aspiring writer.

      "body": "“Once an Arab woman taints her reputation, she cannot be redeemed.”Those are the words I came to understand intimately in my childhood. The demands of purity and a good reputation still influence countless Middle Eastern women to hide their pain and need for assistance.The social rules governing Middle Eastern families may be as different as their migration stories, but the themes are the same: purity, honor, graciousness are all characteristics are paramount for women. The reputation of the family depends on it — and the needs of the family unit outweighs the well-being of its members.For generations, a family’s “good” reputation was tied to their survival and social standing in their homelands. Although these cultural norms are deeply rooted, they are no longer a necessity for survival for immigrants living thousands of miles away. But too often, these norms prevail, and Middle Eastern family members suffer in silence.Nicole Vowell, a 35-year-old Palestinian, Irish woman was raised in a Christian-Palestinian family. They migrated to America as refugees in 1956, and settled in Michigan, where they live today. I was raised in a Muslim-Palestinian family that moved from Kuwait to Texas when I was almost seven.Vowell and I were raised with issues unique to our families. But we were both taught that these issues at home were private and not spoken of publicly. If we were yelled at or belittled, it’s because we deserved it. If we showed symptoms of depression, we were shamed and even called “lazy.” If we held boundaries or asserted our own needs, we were punished for being disrespectful.We both come from good families, and regardless of the mental struggles we experienced, our families loved us — and “one does not turn their back on their family,” we were told. As children, we accepted this and protected our family reputations, covering any faults, mistakes or vulnerabilities.Experiencing mental illness as a woman in the Middle Eastern American community is a matter that remains shrouded in stigma and shame.According to estimates by the U.S. Census Bureau, about 3.7 million Americans claim Arab ancestry, but data on Arab Americans’ health, including mental illness, is missing because they are not identified as an ethnic group. This has led to an inability to provide for their medical and psychological needs.“Arab Americans are in an unusual position in the American health care system — they are a group that both exists in the public consciousness, but is also un-counted, and hence has not been a part of a national reckoning with its needs and particularities,” according to a literature review about the health of Arab Americans in the U.S.Anecdotally, mental illness is common in the Middle East. But if an individual suffering from abuse, toxic environments or struggling with symptoms of mental illness, they are unlikely to report or seek help. This can be explained by the desire to protect family reputation and address issues privately. Indeed, the extended family in Arab culture is at the core of social support, and it is the extended family’s job to resolve abuse or domestic violence. In fact, family members could even be ostracized for seeking formal services — because seeking help publicly is interpreted as an attempt to circumvent the family structure.The concept of psychological health in Middle Eastern culture is constructed through misinformation, a reliance on stereotypes and exaggerated media reports, according to research published at the University of California, Davis. This stigma can only be addressed through comprehensive mental health education and the prioritization of culturally responsive medical and psychological facilities.The attitudes and misinformation often migrate with families to the U.S. In my Palestinian family, an uncle with a history of family trauma died alone in an alley after overdosing one night. His siblings tried to get him help for drug abuse, but it was too late. They did not acknowledge the trauma and mental health issues that led him to use.Vowell believes her mother is unstable because she suffered sexual trauma when she was growing up at the hands of someone in her extended family. No one truly knows the details of her abuse or speaks of it. Vowell’s mother refuses to see a therapist to this day.Vowell grew up to become an award-winning broadcast journalist and later, a communications director. She also mentors women transitioning from careers in TV news to communications.Behind the scenes, however, Vowell has also been working through PTSD, depression, anxiety and ADHD diagnoses, she said. She has been going to therapy since she was 13 years old and became consistent about her healing in the last two and a half years.I moved to Jordan in 2017 and created the independence I once thought to be impossible. My parents initially disowned me but later came to understand the damage that caused. After three years, I moved to California where I worked as a newspaper reporter covering education, the achievement gap and childhood trauma. However, I felt lost, restless and directionless. I returned to therapy and was diagnosed with anxiety and symptoms of depression.Like Vowell and I, other Middle Eastern, millennial women “are paying attention to their psychological states,” said Yassmin Eldouh, a half Egyptian, half Pilipino PhD student at George Washington University studying counseling and human development. There has been a generational shift taking place. “More and more children of immigrants are turning to services every day,” she said.Even when a Middle Eastern woman decides to break cultural norms and seek help, she may not be able to. Some can’t afford the services. Some don’t have the autonomy to seek out a therapist, as they live with their families. And others simply don’t speak enough English and struggle to find someone who can provide services in their language.“Those who can access services often have a hard time finding a therapist who understands their culture,” Eldouh said. “There are religious institutions training their own counselors, but, outside of houses of worship, too few understand the complexities of Middle Eastern culture and religious tradition well enough to work through them to their clients’ satisfaction.”Eldouh became a therapist after suffering through severe anxiety in her own youth. She struggled to find a counselor who understood her culture and family of origin’s dynamics, or even language.Vowell also struggles: her therapist doesn’t understand Palestinian culture. Vowell explains the customs during sessions and sometimes she records conversations with her family members to help her therapist understand.While this generation is making progress, there are still too many women who are seeking the counsel of patriarchal elders with only the reputation of the family at heart. There are still too many women who endure physical and mental harm and suffer in silence.To combat the stigma, I encourage people to learn about mental health and examine how cultural norms have affected you and your family history.A version of this article was published on The Recovery Team’s website.

      "body": "No person or profession is immune from the impact of the broader culture, and our culture was originally structured to support white, male privilege — thus, the professional world continues to suffer from bias and privilege. Counseling is no exception. Good intentions are not enough. Even the sincerest counselors run the risk of harming clients if they don’t practice introspection, unlearning and relearning ways to be more culturally sensitive and equitable.There are many ways to draw from treatment approaches that extend outside the traditional structure created by and for people from dominant cultures, and to foster healing in ways that are meaningful for each unique client. Through this process, we can center our approach around honoring one’s cultural, racial and intersectional identities. This work also entails honoring the need for collective healing, connection and community.To be inclusive, it’s vital to serve clients with an approach that is culturally affirming and acknowledges their intersectional identities, unique healing traditions and practices specific to the client’s culture.A very important part of being inclusive is honoring ancestral and cultural practices within the healing process, and verbalizing support for the ways someone finds hope and healing within their culture and community.  This includes encouraging participation in culturally specific practices and activities that clients personally enjoy. Keep in mind that people in a specific cultural community are unique, and there’s no one activity that will work or fit everyone.The work to be culturally responsive is no easy task and there is no simple formula for getting this right. Every client we work with will require us to change things up in how we communicate with them and adapt their treatment experience to what works best for them.A few ways counselors can adapt is by receiving training on how to use expressive therapeutic techniques, like art, music, play and movement. Also, by embracing telehealth to reach clients who may otherwise lack access to culturally sensitive care.When it comes to fostering effective advocacy and creating meaningful social change, we cannot underestimate the power of the words we use along the way. Language shapes our perception of the world. Thus, it allows us to shape our world with how we think and speak.When counselors use terms that resonate with their clients’ experiences and validate their identities, clients are more likely to feel safe, truly seen and valued. Without this sense of safety and respect, therapists and clients cannot develop an effective therapeutic rapport.A few techniques counselors can use include:Using psychoeducation about the somatic impact of our experiences, especially trauma and oppression, and learning about body-based healing approaches and interventions that honor the mind-body connection. Creative and expressive forms of therapy (like art and music therapy) and incorporating breathwork and movement in therapy sessions create opportunities for clients to reconnect with their bodies and emotions.Healing cannot begin until the counselor has worked with the client to address racist biases and prejudices and acknowledged the nuanced ways clients of color have internalized beliefs that enable and/or add to their own experiences of oppression. Counselors should explore the impact of their client’s acceptance of negative stereotypes about their racial group, which can cause psychological distress and perpetuate harm. Reclaiming and celebrating one’s racial and intersectional identities is one step toward dismantling internalized oppression.As we expand our awareness and interrogate how biases have shaped our language, interactions, beliefs, values and decision-making — we must replace negative stereotypes with empathy, connection and community.While we’ve shifted our notion of “cultural humility” to go a step further to being “culturally responsive,” humility should absolutely remain a priority as we also focus on our responsive actions. No one can ever be an expert in a culture they do not hold membership in, so staying humble and committed to life-long learning is imperative. Making mistakes and acknowledging how we ourselves have participated in oppressive practices is uncomfortable. Through our discomfort and wrestling, we shed what we need to and open ourselves up for opportunities for something much better. Connection over perfection is the goal.The call to action in serving others within a culturally responsive framework requires going above and beyond to listen, reflect, unlearn, reeducate and act. Cultural competence is not enough to do the job of treating clients within a framework that truly honors their cultural and intersectional identities. Going above and beyond means doing your own work to confront and unlearn your own bias and prejudices. It is accepting that we all have internalized racial biases and commitment to “I don’t see color” does nothing to further social justice.  See color, see differences, see how we are alike and see beauty in a diverse community.Christa Butler, MS, LPC, RPT-S is a Licensed Professional Counselor, Registered Play Therapist Supervisor, Nationally Certified TF- CBT Therapist and a Virginia Board of Counseling approved supervisor.

      "body": "Just over a week ago, the 988 Suicide and Crisis line went live. This important initiative will divert callers away from 911 and connect them to local mental health services, resources or alternative crisis responders. While this is a critical step forward in crisis response, we still have a lot of work to do, as only four states have passed legislation to fund 988 call centers, and many local mobile crisis programs have not been augmented to meet the demand that 988 will bring. As they stand, very few mobile crisis teams in the country are available 24/7 — few of them are able to reliably arrive to help an individual in crisis in less than one hour.I’ve been handcuffed in the back of a police car twice in my life — both times during mental health crisis. I wasn’t violent, threatening to hurt myself or noncompliant. It was just the policy. After going through these experiences, I can speak (with personal experience) to why it is essential for us to invest in these lifesaving crisis response resources.The first time, I was handcuffed at the height of a manic episode. I was extremely agitated; My mind and body were locked into high gear as I paced in circles and chattered on about everything that was running through my head. It had been hard to get more than an hour or two of sleep per night at that point, and I’d wake up drenched in sweat. I was exercising all the time and constantly in motion. As a result, I was rail-thin and on the low end of weight fluctuation that accompanied my bipolar disorder. But I hadn’t been diagnosed yet.My girlfriend Meredith was justifiably concerned by my behavior. She had been trained as a Certified Nursing Assistant and worked as a patient care coordinator for a community health organization. So, when she couldn’t convince me to go with her to get assessed at a mental health facility, she thought about requesting a Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) officer. CITs are programs designed to teach law enforcement officers about different types of mental illness and how to use de-escalation and calming techniques to handle people experiencing a mental health crisis.Meredith called 911,explained that this was a mental health crisis and requested that our responder have CIT training. Unfortunately, when the police arrived at the door, they were responding to what they thought was a domestic disturbance. When asked about CIT training, the lead officer seemed unfamiliar with the term.By this time, I was sitting calmly at the kitchen table. I remember thinking that I should keep my hands visible, so I placed them on top of the table. To his credit, even without CIT training, the lead officer quickly assessed the situation and asked me what was going on, why they’d been called and if I could express what I thought might help. He talked with Meredith and asked her what she wanted them to do. She asked if they could help get me to a local mental health facility with a crisis stabilization center. He said they could. I agreed to go.Then he said I’d have to go in handcuffs. Everything almost fell apart. I didn’t get belligerent or combative, but I didn’t want to do a “perp walk” in front of the neighbors. I eventually agreed, in no small part because I could see the toll this was all taking on Meredith.My experience could have gone better — I did not do anything wrong and did not need to be restrained — but it also could have been much worse. And if I weren’t white, it could have been much, much, worse. Police are five times more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men over age 54 than unarmed white men the same age. Police are also more likely to shoot and kill unarmed Black men who exhibit signs of mental illness compared to white men with similar behaviors.That experience was several years ago. I’m now an education, outreach and advocacy volunteer with NAMI Wake County and NAMI North Carolina. They sponsored me to attend the 2022 North Carolina CIT Conference to learn more about CIT and other alternative crisis response models in our state.CIT isn’t the only alternative approach to dealing with mental health crises. For example, co-responder programs embed mental health professionals into patrol divisions so that a law enforcement officer and a mental health professional can respond to crises as two-person teams. There are also Crisis Assistance Helping Out on The Streets (CAHOOTS) programs that respond with two-person teams, but with someone skilled in counseling and de-escalation techniques paired with a medic who is either an EMT or a nurse.Some of the data I saw presented showed that every alternative program studied has provided better outcomes than the traditional approach, with CIT appearing to be most effective in reducing arrests of people with mental illness and increasing the likelihood that individuals will receive mental health services. Among law enforcement officers who have undergone CIT training, 82% believe the training should be mandatory. The element of training that CIT-trained law enforcement officers perceive to be the most beneficial in responding to mental health crisis calls is, by far, the program’s training in de-escalation skills for first responders.Moving forward, we need adequate funding for mobile crisis services, whether through legislation, Medicaid reimbursements or nontraditional funding mechanisms. For example, some funding programs for 911 are still based only on fees from landlines. Since cellular accounts are responsible for more than 80% of total telephone spending, including fees based on cellular service accounts can significantly boost funding.When done well, mobile crisis services save money by putting resources to work where they are most effective. They also reduce officer injuries by up to 80% and, critically, save lives. It's time they became the norm.Ed Ergenzinger is a freelance writer, a patent attorney with a PhD in neuroscience, and a mental health advocate and educator. He also has bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "While the existing models of mental health treatment are founded upon years of research and academic analysis of institutions and people across the world, certain groups of people have been left out of the dialogue — and, historically, they have never had a “place” in healing treatment. This is often rooted in a lack of trust in the system, cultural barriers left behind by old ideologies and racism in all its forms.My academic research background and personal connection to hip-hop has allowed me to discover a new intersectional approach to helping people process trauma. After working in the mental health field for years, and witnessing the lack of cultural competence in our mental health care system, I have become even more committed to uncovering cultural approaches to healing. Specifically, I prioritize using hip-hop for a culture-based approach to healing and personal development.I was left for dead, so to speak, during my adolescence. I experienced violence at home and dealt with parents' mental health issues, substance abuse and other traumas. Yet, in the darkness, I found a faint light: hip-hop.Hip-hop music became my first therapist, my first teacher and my first purpose. When I listened to music, I felt a connection and was able to access my own feelings while beginning to process my trauma. Hearing my own story in the lyrics allowed me to acknowledge my wounds and feel a sense of community during a time of struggle and isolation.Music provided a safe space to explore my thoughts, needs and emotions. It also provided an escape, a way out of my home, even while being at home. Music encouraged me to journal, which became an activity I needed daily and continue to this day.As I entered the mental health space professionally, I witnessed how treatment lacked cultural competence, and I felt limited due to the one-size-fits all treatment model of: Come in, share your experience, identify areas for healing and feel better. This traditional model did not leave space for discussing culture, traditions or how identity operates in forming our sense of self. If a mental health professional had ever asked what music I listen to and why, it would have helped me reflect and understand myself better.There are emerging modalities, like Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT), that bring a breath of fresh air to the field. As I learned how to apply ACT, I realized how important acceptance is for moving past mental obstacles. ACT offers another way to process, to reflect and to be. We often focus goals of treatment on progress, neglecting the fact that some traumas and behaviors will remain, and we need to be able to accept that some traumas linger in the mind and body.After witnessing new techniques in ACT, I began to realize just how important it was to explore fresh perspectives and develop new methods. This got me thinking about how hip-hop music could be a pathway for healing techniques.While working in the mental health field, I heard stories of trauma, which, in turn, connected me to my own traumas from the past. I began to feel the experiences of others in their words. While recording youth telling their stories, I could see them. I mean really “see them” — not just their behaviors or words, but the fullness of their experience. This challenged me to explore the sense of connection that I found in the lyrics in hip-hop music.Hip-hop elements (DJing, MCing, graffiti or dance) provide multiple angles for development. I have taken the practice of rhyming and expression in order to tap into a person’s inner narrative, which, in turn, offers clients a direct line to their own mental health challenges. By doing this, I can help them reframe their inner narrative, which is a major tenant of mental health treatment. Within a 10-week period, we go through a variety of topics with a strong focus on social justice and mental health — not through a traditional academic approach, but one grounded in the experience of rhyming and expressing yourself. Ultimately, the program aims for clients to channel their own voices to heal. We use recording equipment to help with this final piece, which gives the clients agency over their own healing and the opportunity to hear the product of their words.Without cultural context and a deep understanding, using hip-hop as a part of treatment could cause a disconnect. This means that practitioners using hip-hop culture, such as rapping, should study the culture beforehand to better prepare for a variety of outcomes, including a client being triggered by the content. With appropriate preparation and understanding, a practitioner can provide a safe space for processing.It’s time to share what hip-hop is, a powerful path to develop and find purpose. Mental health needs something new, something intentional. It also needs something inclusive. Next time you are listening to your favorite track, reflect on what you’re hearing. What message is there? What potential can you find in the words? Perhaps if you listen well enough, you may just hear yourself in the stories that hip-hop shares with the world.Anthony Pineda founded the Creatrix Institute with the vision of building community, promoting healing, integrating culture and giving people access to personal development.

This is highly concerning and relevant, as 2% of younger Americans identify as transgender, a term that refers to people whose gender identity (an internal sense of self) does not align with the sex they were assigned at birth.A gender transition, or the process a transgender person undergoes to express their gender more in line with their internal identity, is a critical component of maintaining their mental health. Research shows that transitioning in affirming environments is life-saving for many transgender people; supportive communities, culturally competent health care and choosing a new name and gender pronouns improves mental health outcomes, including suicidality (which transgender people are significantly more at risk for).Conversely, non-affirming environments and systemic barriers to health care result in higher rates of depression, suicidality and substance misuse in the transgender community, as compared to their cisgender peers. Therefore, we have reason to believe that this anti-LGBTQ+ legislation will worsen the mental health of our transgender youth and adolescents, in addition to increasing the stigma experienced by an already vulnerable population.This challenge is compounded by a shortage of affirming health care providers for the transgender community. As a transgender physician living with mental illness, I understand the fear and pain that the stigma of transgender identity and mental illness can bear when receiving health care services. I am often left feeling unseen or ignored by the health care system at times of my greatest need.In 2015, the National Center for Transgender Equality performed the largest survey of adult transgender community members living within the U.S. The results are eye-opening and point to largescale systemic barriers preventing transgender people from receiving medically-necessary health care services of adequate quality and cultural competence.These findings demonstrate an unaddressed public health issue, but also, they are impacting real people in their everyday lives.While my experience does not represent the full diversity of the gender expansive community, my hope is that sharing my experience will help other transgender people with mental illness feel less alone and have hope for recovery in their journeys.Since coming out and transitioning, I have faced unexpected discrimination within the health care system, even as a physician myself. On multiple occasions, I have been refused medically necessary health care specifically due to my gender identity. This discrimination worsened when I began openly identifying to my providers as a patient experiencing a serious mental illness. Even living in New York City, there are few mental health providers who understand and are affirming of transgender patients. There are even fewer who are transgender themselves or willing to disclose they have lived experience with a serious mental illness.I would have more trust in a mental health provider who is my peer: that is, someone who has lived experience with mental illness and the resulting stigma. As a result, I often need to teach my mental health providers about what it is like to live as a transgender person in recovery from serious mental illness. And professionally, I am left with a small number of colleagues who openly share my identities.When I do find affirming providers, my commercial health care insurance has not covered their services on multiple occasions. I am privileged to be a physician, and therefore, can pay for many of these transition-related expenses out of pocket. This in turn buys me further “passing” privilege, meaning I have undergone a medical and surgical transition, which allows me to appear cisgender. However, there are many others who cannot afford to undergo a medical or surgical transition, or do not wish to do so.I often ask my treating physicians if they have experienced serious mental illness. This is most often met with, “that is none of your business,” when, in fact, I believe it is highly relevant. In these moments, my provider made me feel like they believed mental illness was something shameful. In many stigmatized and shame-based mental illnesses, disclosing a shared identity with a patient can be healing and increase trust in the relationship between patient and physician. Conversely, acknowledging potential awareness gaps and implicit bias is also an important practice for all health care providers.For me, once experiencing the societal sting of transphobia, any other stigmas I hold are no longer worth hiding. I proudly share my identities as a transgender physician living with mental illness, and I believe these experiences have increased my value to society as I can better understand my patients’ perspective and their place within the full range of humanity. This understanding is the basis for a cultural awareness which can improve the healing environment of our offices and the social well-being of our patients.In recent years, I have met many adolescents who boldly identify as neurodivergent, transgender community members. I have faith this generation can help teach physicians to holistically treat their patients and the environmental factors impacting the health of their brains and bodies. I hope some of these adolescents will say, “I can become a doctor, too.”  Because they can, and we can do better to make room for them.If you are transgender and have symptoms of mental illness, please contact a provider experienced in gender-affirming therapy at the World Professional Association of Transgender Health: https://www.wpath.org/provider/search.The Trevor Project has free, confidential, 24/7 support services for LGBTQ+ youth: https://www.thetrevorproject.org/.The following are resources from the Human Rights Campaign on LGBTQ+ youth: https://www.hrc.org/resources/lgbtq-youth.The following are educator resources from the Gay and Lesbian & Straight Education Network: https://www.glsen.org/resources/educator-resources.Pledge to take the 2022 US Trans Survey and increase transgender representation in health care policies, research, education and practice: https://www.ustranssurvey.org/.Z.

      "body": "My father was a psychiatrist in the 1960s, ‘70s and ‘80s. Like many mental health practitioners of his time, he tended to define people by their supposed pathologies: “This one is a depressive,” or “That one is borderline,” and even “Oh, she’s got a paranoid personality.”Thankfully, mental health awareness has progressed significantly since then. With anxiety and depression reaching epidemic levels, the movement to understand and prioritize mental health is gaining momentum, and people everywhere are embracing their diagnoses. The knowledge that they’re living with a health condition like “generalized anxiety disorder” or “major depressive disorder” helps them feel less ashamed of — and less isolated in — their experience. Changing attitudes have also made strides toward destigmatizing treatment like therapy and medication.However, the current conversation about anxiety and depression is lacking a vital dimension: emotional awareness. We are now learning that many instances of anxiety and depression are actually symptoms of buried core emotions and unmet core needs. These types of symptoms — and the use of ineffective treatments to address them — could be prevented with more education surrounding emotions and trauma.Emotions are biological: they live in the body as much as the brain, and they evolved to perform essential functions in our lives. We believe there to be seven innate or “core” emotions that are hard-wired in our nervous systems: anger, sadness, fear, joy, disgust, excitement and sexual excitement. These emotions have a lifespan; when we allow ourselves to feel them (not necessarily acting on them, but allowing the emotions to express themselves), they move through the body and mind and naturally recede like a wave.Then there are the “inhibitory” emotions: anxiety, guilt and shame. These emotions are designed to block core emotions when core emotions come into conflict with what pleases others (like our parents, peers and partners). For example, Lauren, a 40-year-old mother of a three-year-old named Betsy, grew up in a home with lots of violence. As a result, Lauren grew to fear the core emotion of anger, and she learned to shut down her own anger as well as Betsy’s, as it was too threatening for her to tolerate. When Betsy started to express anger at a toy being taken away, for example, Lauren yelled at her: “DON’T EVER TALK TO MOMMY THAT WAY!!” This sudden explosion scared Betsy. As time passed and no room was ever made for Betsy to safely experience her anger, or have it validated by her parents, Betsy’s mind and body learned to suppress anger using muscular contraction and holding her breath. Now instead of feeling anger, Betsy experiences anxiety.Another reason we block core emotions with inhibitory emotions is to prevent us from being overwhelmed or “dysregulated.” When core emotions become too intense, we can shut them down using anxiety, guilt, and/or shame. For example, Tom was taught by his father that “crying and expressing sadness is for weaklings.” Now as a grown man, he feels ashamed every time he feels sad. Feeling shame for his true and natural sadness has contributed to his depression.Because most people don’t know about core and inhibitory emotions, they may feel they are “genetically defective” or “damaged goods.” However, symptoms of anxiety and depression caused by avoided and buried core emotions can be healed with therapy and even eased by simply understanding how emotions work in the mind and body. The issue is that relatively few psychiatrists are taught about the science of emotions in medical school, so they risk misdiagnosing their patients and allowing the root cause of symptoms — the blocked emotions — to go unaddressed.Renowned psychologist Diana Fosha teaches that trauma and psychopathology is caused by experiencing overwhelming emotions in the face of unwanted, utter loneliness. Using this definition, it becomes clear that trauma is a universal human experience. How many of us have had to face our feelings alone for fear of judgment, abandonment or retaliation?Trauma often happens in families and relationships when there’s emotional neglect or abuse. But trauma isn’t limited to what happens in families and relationships: we live in a society and a world filled with violence, stress and injustice.Compounding our distress is the fact that parents and schools have, for the most part, not been given the proper tools to address this subject — and they are often unequipped when it comes to emotional health. As a result, they are not prepared to help children process overwhelming emotions — which is vital for raising calm, confident kids in the context of a chaotic, traumatic world.Additionally, parents who don’t know how to deal with their own strong emotions are unlikely to be capable of helping their children deal with their feelings. Even the most well-intentioned parents can shut down their children’s emotions, and many schools lack the resources they need to help students thrive emotionally.Thus, many children grow up feeling isolated and ashamed of their own emotions. Being shamed and left alone with emotions makes burying them the main strategy to deal with them. With little help for our growing anxieties, we are often left with simmering traumatic stress, which we numb with defensive behaviors, growing further addicted, distracted and disconnected. Perhaps we develop a destructive relationship with food, alcohol or drugs. Perhaps we isolate or lash out.Healing entails processing these emotions, allowing our nervous systems to come back into balance and calm.After receiving my degree in social work, I trained in a healing-oriented, trauma-informed method called accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy (AEDP). In AEDP, symptoms are the starting points to discover the underlying core emotions and needs so we can name them, validate them, honor them and move through them to greater peace and calm.The goal of this process is to move from our defenses, through our inhibitory emotions, to reach our blocked core emotions that are causing the symptoms. Once the blocked emotions are named and validated, people experience enormous amounts of relief, ultimately feeling more confident, calm and connected with their authentic selves. The Change Triangle is a handy map to understand how to move from disconnected depressed states through our core emotions to a more balanced state between our thoughts and emotions.I believe that school health classes should include emotions education in their curricula, and teachers and guidance counselors should receive an emotions education in their own training. Parenting books should include this information as well to help parents learn to be emotionally available, neither threatened by nor frightened of their children’s emotions. On the contrary, they would learn to listen to their children’s feelings with interest but not react, modeling for their children how to validate and be with their emotions.In this ideal world, adults are also better equipped to deal with stress and conflict in their own lives. Whether we are angry, sad, afraid or joyful, those emotions would be named, validated and supported. And we would all learn about triggers — those events that evoke intense emotional experiences. We would rest assured that life triggers strong emotions, and that that is completely natural and normal. It’s the knowledge, tools and practice we’d have that would enable us to respond to triggers in constructive ways.A society with a strong foundation in emotional awareness is a society with high rates of physical and mental well-being. It’s a society that prioritizes authentic connection and collaborative community, because it understands what it truly means to be human.Hilary Jacobs Hendel is author of the international award-winning book, “It’s Not Always Depression: Working the Change Triangle to Listen to the Body, Discover Core Emotions, and Connect to Your Authentic Self” (Random House).

      "body": "In 2013, I was hospitalized — and my entire outlook on life shifted. My doctor diagnosed me with bipolar disorder. My mind was spinning; I didn’t think that someone like me could have that illness. There’s no way I could be crazy, I thought, because I am not weak. Looking back, I can understand that I had been influenced by the tropes of people with mental illness as unsuccessful and fragile. Since then, I have developed coping strategies to manage my illness, stuck to a medication regimen and received both inpatient and outpatient treatment with psychiatrists, therapists and support groups. I soon discovered there’s strength in seeking and accepting help.During this same period, I also experienced major personal and professional success; I earned my master’s degree in public policy before I turned 23, won competitive scholarships, and awards, published my writing and given lectures, interviews and legislative testimony.I’m sharing my story as a reminder that everyday people living with mental health conditions are as capable of success as anyone else — and our identities range far beyond “person with mental illness.” Sometimes, admittedly, untangling my mental illness from my identity is hard. I see myself as a proud, Black cisgender woman who is also a daughter, writer, college graduate, sister, niece, friend, policy researcher, aunt, basketball fan and avid reader, among other things. Over time, I have learned that I can be all these things and find success while living with a mental health condition.Feeling comfortable with the wholeness of my identity took time. Honestly, I’m still grappling with identifying as someone with a mental illness, without letting it define me. I know this will take time.A critical step in accepting my intersecting identities is not letting my mental illness take away from everything I want to be. There are days when I struggle to function — and I have found ways to accept that there will be tough days, but there are ways to ensure that they don’t take over my life.For example, to be a writer, I need rest so I can focus and think clearly. But there are days where I cannot get out of bed, and other days when I can’t sleep; having a sleep imbalance makes producing essays like this a challenge. But when I use my coping skills, take my medication and, when necessary, contact my support team, I am stable and subsequently productive.The phrase “three steps forward, two steps back” captures my experience. While engaging and being productive in life, I have also gone through dark days that resulted in hospital stays.At the beginning of each hospital admission, I would feel crushed. I felt like I was moving backward — that my good fortune had reached the end of its road. But I discovered the same thing about my identity after each hospital stay: I am so much more than my mental illness.I was eventually able to tell myself that being in the hospital was a mental tune-up, and I was there getting help to get back on track.I have attended group therapy and outpatient programs where I’ve met people with similar mental health symptoms, and we’ve connected on a level I cannot with people who don’t have a mental illness. It feels like we have built an instant community.Belonging to a community of diverse individuals who live with a mental illness and also have different — and sometimes overlapping — identities makes me feel less alone and helps me to feel supported.It also helps to see public figures joining our community. I was encouraged when National Basketball Association (NBA) Champion Kevin Love opened up about his life with mental illness and how he still finds success and joy on the basketball court. His story and many other athletes' stories are a reminder that living with a mental illness is not a recipe for failure. Moreover, these stories remind us that it’s ok to be open about living with a mental illness and to allow it to be one piece of who you are.Ultimately, I’ve found that having a mental health condition has added unexpected positives to my life; it has provided me with opportunities to build community and meet inspiring people who have helped me to accept and celebrate myself.I am not sure what the future holds, which is both frightening and exciting. I am unsure how much my mental health will affect my life. But I will continue to cherish my identities, make them stronger and build a deeper connection with them.I’ve accepted there will be obstacles to mental stability, but I’ve also accepted there will be more triumphs. I know I am a multifaceted woman who deserves to thrive today.Next year will be 10 years since I was diagnosed with a mental illness. Despite my humbling success, my personal trials and my inspiring relationships, the real connection between my mental illness and my identity is up to me.Brakeyshia Samms is a writer and policy researcher living with a mental illness.

      "body": "About 2 million times each year, people with mental illness are booked in our nation’s jails, often because communities rely on law enforcement to respond to mental health crises — and they lack the needed resources to truly support someone in crisis. It should not be the job of law enforcement to respond to health care crises, and people experiencing a mental health emergency deserve quick access to effective mental health care — just as people expect when experiencing physical health emergencies.In 2020, Congress passed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, creating 988 as the nationwide number for suicide prevention and mental health crisis response. This number will be available in every community beginning in July this year, with the goal of connecting people in mental health crisis with mental health services.NAMI supports the National Guidelines for Behavioral Health Crisis Care, released by the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) in early 2020. This framework identifies three pillars of services that every person experiencing a mental health crisis should have:The second pillar, mobile crisis teams (MCTs), presents an opportunity to significantly reduce the role of law enforcement in mental health crisis response. Unfortunately, very few communities currently have this type of service available.Ultimately, the goal of MCTs is to provide effective and timely care, while allowing individuals to remain in their communities, whenever possible.One of the most well-known and established MCT programs is CAHOOTS, Crisis Assistance Helping Out On The Streets, which has been operating in Eugene, Ore., through the White Bird Clinic since 1989. In a NAMI Ask the Expert special webinar series last year featuring CAHOOTS Program Director Ebony Morgan, she described their program as “operating in unarmed pairs with an EMT and a crisis worker.” The service is available throughout the city offering crisis intervention, support and resources to the community.CAHOOTS and similar MCT programs are often dispatched when someone calls 911 or non-emergency police lines. When 988 becomes available, ideally 988 call centers will also be able to dispatch CAHOOTS-like teams — although 911 and 988 should always be in close collaboration. Once on the scene, MCTs assess a situation and are, as Morgan says, “ready to be helpful in whatever way is most effective.”In some cases, a family member may call and request law enforcement, but Morgan notes that often, “Family members don’t know that we’re an option.” In these cases, CAHOOTS will work closely with dispatch and can be sent to the scene. There, they can build rapport with the individual, provide on-the-spot counseling and de-escalation, or transport the individual to a local emergency room that has psychiatric services, if needed.Sometimes, an individual who needs more care than can be provided in the community may not want to go to the hospital. The team can’t force anyone to go anywhere, so instead, they try to explain how it might be helpful. “It’s a lot more comfortable to come with us of your own choice and just ride in the back of our van than to be handcuffed and put in a police vehicle and taken there against your will,” says Morgan. Once at the hospital, the team provides a warm handoff by sharing information with the hospital staff.MCT programs provide many types of support in addition to crisis response. They can provide grief counseling or wellness check-ins They are also trained in basic medical care and carry Narcan, a prescription medication that can reverse an opioid overdose, in case they are first to arrive on the scene. Morgan says CAHOOTS “brings both the medical and crisis intervention perspectives, which allows us to have a more holistic approach to each call.”CAHOOTS leaders agree that partnership with law enforcement is critical. “We are not trained in law enforcement and do not have the same authority as police,” says Morgan. But the partnership with local police is a benefit to everyone, especially law enforcement. “It benefited the police when they were able to drop someone off that did not need to be in jail but did need some support.”Now, CAHOOTS holds monthly meetings with the police department and works collaboratively to solve problems for the community together. Some situations require both the police and the CAHOOTS team to respond together, or one may call on the other for help. “What we do is work with these partners to figure out in what way we can best meet the situation’s needs.”The evidence surrounding the impact of MCTs is compelling. MCTs have been shown to save money by reducing the number of hospital admissions and incarceration for people with mental health needs or substance use disorders. Nearly 85% of people who had an interaction with an MCT received an intervention other than hospitalization.People who have become disconnected from mental health services are more likely to re-engage with those services after having contact with an MCT. This is especially true for those with depressive disorder, mood disorders and psychotic disorders.Creating these teams locally is not a given; advocates will have to push for their availability to ensure that the response we need to divert from justice system involvement when someone calls 988 is available everywhere. It’s critical that advocates push for these programs in their communities and across their state. Bringing key stakeholders to the table, including law enforcement, is important to build programs that have buy-in and cross-system support.There are also opportunities for funding MCT programs that can be leveraged immediately. The recently-enacted American Rescue Plan Act included an option for state Medicaid programs to cover mobile crisis services, which was named after the CAHOOTS program and championed by Senator Ron Wyden (D–Ore). States can currently choose to provide this in their Medicaid program. Additionally, a pending proposal in Congress would establish a grant program to help communities create CAHOOTS-like mobile crisis teams.As we reimagine the future of mental health care, supporting MCTs will be a critical step in transforming our currently insufficient approach to crisis response.Learn more about 988 and the crisis services NAMI is advocating for by visiting nami.org/988.

      "body": "As a mental health specialist and someone who has multiple mental illnesses and associated disabilities, I am no stranger to stigma and discrimination.I have been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. While I do not have any physical disabilities, I have disabilities associated with my mental illnesses, such as fibromyalgia, that are invisible to others and limit my ability to work. I have been invalidated and outright confronted with discrimination when I verbalize my disability status, and how my mental illnesses are the cause of my disabilities.Disability and mental illness alone are accompanied by significant stigma and discrimination, but when paired together, they result in a unique experience the mental health community calls, “double discrimination.” Mental illness is still so misunderstood, and when an individual has severe mental illnesses that contribute to their disability status, or they have physical disabilities paired with mental illness, others are often unable or unwilling to understand the complex experience. Often, they simply can’t accept another’s experience for what it is.I have learned that I am not responsible for another’s misunderstanding of my experience. However, as a mental health specialist with lived experience, I have found that I can use my perspective to help and educate others.If you also have disabilities and mental illness, the following coping mechanisms may help you navigate double discrimination.This first coping mechanism may be difficult to practice. Speaking out can often be intimidating, but it is important that you have the opportunity to address and condemn discrimination and stigma. One way of speaking out is by telling your story.There are many avenues to share your story and connect with others who may be going through something similar, such as becoming a presenter for NAMI In Our Own Voice. Having this outlet will also add to the collective discussion around double discrimination and help promote acceptance and understanding.I find that I commonly view the discrimination I’ve faced as being my fault; that my disabilities and mental illnesses aren’t “that bad” or that I don’t have the right to be considered disabled. But what I try to remember is that these beliefs have been thrust upon me. I am not the problem. My needs matter and I am important just as I am — and so are you. You are not the problem, the pervasive stigma and discrimination in our society is the problem. Give yourself grace and please remember that discrimination is never your fault.Discrimination can make us feel lesser, and that is a difficult emotional place to navigate. Please take the time to be kind to yourself. Notice any negative self-talk that might arise and try challenging it with affirmations. Some of my favorites are, “My body does not define my worth,” and “My experience is valid.” Try to find some affirmations that you like and write them on sticky notes to put up around your living area where you will see them often. This helps me when I put them on my mirrors, so that the first thing I see when going to look at myself is a positive affirmation.This process is an effective coping mechanism and critical for changing the conversation surrounding mental illness and disability. If you are being discriminated against, it is important that you know that any form of rights violations is a kind of abuse. If you have questions about whether what your experiencing is a violation of your rights, the Department of Justice operates a toll-free information line to provide information and materials to the public about the requirements of Americans with Disabilities Act.If your rights are being violated, reporting may be necessary. The NAMI HelpLine can help you to find resources in your area1 to report discrimination.Sometimes when we experience discrimination, we begin to feel less than, which can lead us to abandon our self-care measures. It is during these times that our self-care is of the utmost importance. Try to make sure that you are practicing self-care, even if that means just keeping up with your hygiene rituals. Even simple things, like going on a walk or talking through how you feel with someone you trust, can help. It’s essential to ensure that you are receiving the care you deserve and that often starts with self-care.My experience with double discrimination has often taken the form of watching others deny my story and experience, simply because my disabilities and mental illness are “invisible.” Naturally, this left me feeling invalidated. However, I will always remind myself that just because my challenges are invisible to others, they are not any less real. No one has the right to discredit me and negate my experience.My hopes are that these coping mechanisms encourage you to stand up for yourself and be seen. If adopting these strategies takes time, be kind to yourself; this form of discrimination can be incredibly painful and difficult to work through. You deserve validation and understanding just as much as anyone else.\n\n\nAshley Nestler, MSW, is a survivor of schizoaffective disorder, quiet borderline personality disorder, fibromyalgia, bulimia nervosa, obsessive compulsive disorder and Complex PTSD.

I’ve even written about other people’s mental health journeys, but I have so much trouble finding the words to describe my own.I’m pretty sure I barely said more than a few words the first time I saw a therapist. But I’ve always been that way. I’m half Filipino and grew up in a small Southern town. Needless to say, I stuck out. In fact, I was the only Asian kid in every school I went to before high school. I didn’t notice until another kid pointed it out to me. Then it was all I could see.The bullying was about what you’d expect: Kids asking me if I ate cats or dogs or made fun of the way my food smelled. I’d like to say I didn’t let this kind of stuff get to me, but I was young, so of course it did. And instead of fighting back, I decided to isolate myself. If no one noticed me, I figured, they wouldn’t make fun of me.I became an expert at blending into the background — only speaking when spoken to and ignoring anyone saying something offensive. I would go straight home after school and retreat to my room instead of joining after-school clubs or sports teams.I don’t know if this was where the depression found its opportunity to latch onto me, but I do remember being withdrawn, especially when it came to crowded social situations.The first time I remember feeling depressed was sometime in middle school. Everything I used to love seemed less interesting. It was like the world had lost all its color, and I was the only one who’d noticed.At the time, I thought this must be something everyone goes through. If not, I reasoned, that means I’m “crazy.” And I didn’t need something else making me stick out, so I kept these thoughts and feelings to myself.I’d have these feelings off and on, but mostly, my school life was normal. I managed to make a few friends despite my isolation tactics, and I’d have my good days and bad days. That was until I finished high school and found out there were ways to make those bad feelings go away.I started to use drugs and alcohol to numb my feelings. This self-medicating worked until the drugs triggered my anxiety. During my worst trip, I had a bad panic attack. I was so convinced that I was going to die that I called my girlfriend to hear her voice one last time. Thankfully, I was able to make it through the panic attack with her help, and afterwards, doctors prescribed me anti-anxiety medications. I figured that this medication would end the struggles I was facing.It wasn’t long after that I experienced the worst depressive episode of my life. Simply “getting through” every day felt like a challenge. Nothing I used to love made me feel better, and I felt like I was becoming a burden to my friends and family. One night, I considered ending my life. I considered it for a long time. In a moment of clarity, I called my girlfriend (now wife), and she convinced me to go to the emergency room.I was always adamant about checking myself into a hospital for mental health issues. The same thoughts kept running through my head: What if someone finds out? What will my parents think? Will I be able to go back to school after this? But I just couldn’t take it anymore. If the doctors couldn’t help me, then I had nothing to look forward to. I already felt dead.I ended up spending a week in the hospital’s mental health ward, where I saw my first therapist and met others experiencing the same illness. Granted, everyone had their own stories and reasons for being there, but we found common ground. Though I was scared, I ended up learning a lot about myself during that hospital stay. And I still had a lot more to learn.Over the years since my hospital visit, I’ve continued seeing a therapist, who has helped me realize that no one can “fix me.” I’m the only one that can find the right coping mechanisms. And every day I’m working to be a better, happier version of myself. I still have bad days. I have days where everything seems grey, and nothing makes me happy. However, I can see myself through those days now. I feel as though I’m still stuck in the middle of a forest, but at least this time, I know the way out. Even if it is a long, dark walk.Anyone who lives with depression knows that finding emotional well-being is less of an uphill battle and more of an up-and-down roller coaster. It is a journey that requires vulnerability, patience and resilience.I’ve learned that when it comes to the Asian-American experience with mental illness, our stories our similar, but never exactly the same. I’ve met members of our community who said their family told them to hide their mental illness as it could keep them from getting a good job. My family may not have understood what I was going though at first, but they’ve always been supportive of me seeking out help.What we all seem to share is a shame that goes along with having a mental illness. And that shame can come from many places; be it the pressure of trying to fit into a place when you feel like it doesn’t want you, or the pressure of trying to meet high expectations. Either way, a lot of us don’t like talking about our mental health.I’m not sure there’s a way to get rid of the shame, especially since a lot of us have dealt with it from a young age. But I can feel myself getting better. And I can only hope others with mental illness can also find healthy ways to deal with it.To those struggling with depression (particularly young people) who haven’t told anyone about it, I urge you to share. I know that disclosing this information can be difficult, especially in a community that, traditionally, hasn’t been as open to discussing mental illness as it should.But there is help available.John Ridlehoover lives with his wife and two dogs in South Carolina.

      "body": "Although rooted in ancient civilizations and found in every culture, music is often not recognized as central to wellness and therapeutic services. However, through my academic and professional work as a music therapist, I have witnessed the healing power of music.Music therapy is an evidenced-based, safe and effective form of treatment provided by trained professionals and can be a part of a successful treatment program for people with mental health needs. If you’re interested in exploring music therapy, here is what you need to know.According to the American Music Therapy Association, music therapy is “an established health profession in which music is used within a therapeutic relationship to address physical, emotional, cognitive and social needs of individuals.”Starting with an assessment, a qualified music therapist develops a treatment plan, including a variety of music-based activities to address the clients’ needs and desires for treatment. Through this process, clients can improve depressive symptoms, increase emotional expression, develop positive relationships, address loneliness, grief and loss — and improve their overall quality of life. Music therapy also provides avenues for communication that can be helpful to those who find it difficult to express themselves using words.The following activities serve as interventions to address goals around self-regulation, coping skills, emotional expression, enhanced mood, social interactions, attention and focus:Listening to music:  This can include listening to music for relaxation, performance improvement, to regulate internal systems (such as blood pressure, heart rate, etc.) and to reminisce on past memories or experiences.Musical re-creation:  This approach can address self-expression by playing or singing along to new or familiar tunes.Improvisation: Improvisation is the act of creating unplanned music alone or with someone else. This can increase connection and engagement and foster self-expression. It can also increase attention and focus through active listening and response.Songwriting: A client and music therapist will work together to create and notate instrumental and/or lyrical music. This technique can address emotional and social goals for the client.Music games and lessons: This approach uses planned musical activities to promote rehabilitation in an engaging way.Music therapy can help people in many areas of life. This may include emotion and mood regulation, psychological stability, physical health, spirituality, cognitive maintenance/development and social benefits. Other benefits of music therapy include:A professional music therapist holds a bachelor's degree or higher in music therapy from an AMTA-approved college and university programs. The curriculum focuses on: musical foundations, clinical foundations and music therapy principles as specified in the AMTA Professional Competencies. In addition to the academic coursework, the bachelor's degree requires 1200 hours of clinical training, including a supervised internship. Graduate degrees in music therapy focus on advanced clinical practice and research.Music therapy is offered in both individual and group formats in child and adolescent behavioral health, as well as with adults. Music therapists are found in many settings, including inpatient and outpatient psychiatric hospitals, detoxification and relapse prevention programs, forensic or correctional settings, private in-home services and many more. It has demonstrated effectiveness for clients living with schizophrenia spectrum and other psychotic disorders, bipolar and related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, substance-related disorders, trauma and stressor-related disorders, disorders, personality disorders and more.Music therapy is also an effective treatment method for children with mental health needs. Because of the nonthreatening nature of music, children often respond well to music interventions and enjoy this treatment model. When guided by a clinical music therapist, music can help children and adolescents:The same rules apply for seeking music therapy as any other mental health service. When symptoms are interfering significantly with your day-to-day life, with your ability to go to or be productive at work/ school or interfering with your relationships, music therapy may be a good treatment. If you’re looking to improve depressive symptoms, improve emotional expression, foster positive relationships, or address loneliness, grief and loss, then you should consider pursuing this model of treatment.If you are feeling overwhelmed or experiencing grief, living with substance abuse and/or dependence, have experienced a traumatic event or sustained trauma, music therapy would be a good avenue to address these concerns.To learn more, The American Music Therapy Association recommends accessing “The Journal of Music Therapy: (JMT) and “Music Therapy Perspectives” (MTP) social media channels:Melinda Murray, MM, MT-BC is a Board-Certified Music Therapist with 12 years of experience working at Kalamazoo Psychiatric Hospital in Kalamazoo, Mich.  Her undergraduate degree is from DUNY Fredonia in Music Therapy and Minority Studies, and she received her master’s degree from Western Michigan University in music therapy with a master’s certificate in holistic health.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Throughout my childhood, I was often punished for my emotions: if I had an angry outburst, if I cried or if I was frustrated and had an “attitude.” I know that my parents loved me, and that they were only parenting the best way they knew how, based on their own upbringing. I know they meant me no harm. But their actions were, indeed, harmful; it would take me years to fully process the extent of the trauma.I’ve learned that there is no taking back past actions and changing our history. But there can be healing.The thing about healing is, not only do many of us not know it’s possible — we do not even know we need it. For a long time, I didn’t. But five years ago, with the help of a therapist, I realized that the word “trauma” applies to some of my past experiences. Since then, I have made baby steps in my healing journey.At first, I believed that childhood trauma could be dealt with quickly; after my therapist and I revisited some of these past traumas, I thought, well, that’s that, I’m healed.In reality, I had a long way to go. Sometimes, having revisited my past feels like opening a floodgate of utter chaos. Often, I find myself drowning in my emotions.In addition to processing my past, I had to face the challenges of our mental health care system. My therapist left the practice for another one that didn’t take my insurance. After that, I bounced around to several different therapists, which added more stress to my journey.With my current therapist, I feel like I’m making progress again, although slow. Painfully slow. So slow that the day before Easter Sunday, I got triggered and began experiencing suicidal thoughts. I planned to take my life and wrote goodbye letters to my mom, my two children (who were with their father) and my two best friends.I cried so hard, writing those letters. I have lost a loved one to suicide, so I knew, as I wrote them, exactly how my loved ones would feel once I was gone. In the moment, I was willing to inflict that pain to alleviate my own. But by the time I finished writing the fifth letter, I was spent. I just wanted to sleep. I decided to reassess in the morning.The next morning, I went for an assessment at a behavioral health hospital near my home. I was admitted to an inpatient program, where I stayed for eight days. Currently, I am completing an outpatient partial hospitalization program. The group therapies, both inpatient and out, have been incredibly helpful to me.In one group discussion, we talked about radical acceptance — specifically, about “turning the mind” toward acceptance. We talked about willfulness and combating willfulness. I shared how it was only very recently that I learned it is often necessary to “sit with” uncomfortable emotions — to fight the urge to avoid or immediately “fix” that uneasy feeling.When I felt loneliness or grief or overwhelming sorrow, my mind often chastised me and demanded I think differently: “Reframe the thought! Positive affirmations!” But my time in therapy taught me that I can talk back to this voice in my head without being negative. I can answer it with “I’m allowed to feel this way!”Giving myself permission to feel my grief and sorrow — for things that happened at all stages of my life — was an important step.There is nuance in every lesson. I need to learn to “sit with” the difficult feelings — but without sitting so long that the pain overwhelms me for an extended amount of time. I never want the pain to cause me to question whether I want to continue living again. But I am learning.The depth of the pain I feel, when I allow myself to feel it, is not necessarily lessening. And I don’t know if it ever will. But what I do know is allowing myself to feel my feelings is progress.I am not okay, and that’s okay. I am not alone. I am allowed to feel the way I feel. We can’t heal what we don’t let ourselves feel.This blog post was written by an anonymous contributor with the help of NAMI Staff.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I experienced my first panic attack when I was only nine years old. It happened out of the blue, while I was in school, and I didn't know what was happening to me. All of a sudden, I couldn't breathe. I stuck my head out the window to catch my breath, assuming the difficulty breathing was due to allergies. When my breathing did not improve, I ran into the hallway, where I fell to the ground, overwhelmed and feeling intense pain all over my body. I didn't faint, but I felt light-headed and dreadful.My nine-year-old self immediately thought, \"I'm dying!\"The school wanted to call an ambulance, but they reached my parents first, and my mom rushed to my rescue. She knew how much I was suffering from bullying and stress at the time, and she attributed my symptoms to a panic attack.Thankfully, I got into therapy almost immediately after the incident. I was initially diagnosed with claustrophobia; however, through my work in therapy, I have learned that the claustrophobia was just a manifestation of my fears and problems. My behavior was always caused by an underlying stress — in this case, being bullied — rather than being about small spaces. In fact, sometimes I would be in a large room, but I would escape to a smaller space so I could have a reason to break down and externalize the pain I was feeling.Today, I’m still working with my therapist who is a wonderful woman. With her, I can discuss everything that is on my mind, and usually feel much better after the session. We don’t reach solutions right away, but I’ve found that for every problem, sooner or later, I will find an answer or a way to cope.I’m 14 years old now, and a lot has changed in the past five years. The bullying stopped, and I no longer have claustrophobia or the urge to incite my own panic. But I still face mental health challenges.My panic attacks continue, but they have evolved to coincide with new triggers — including crowds of people, how others talk to me, certain words or the volume at which someone speaks to me. This can be difficult to manage, as certain people and teachers at school also trigger me. It may seem odd to others, but these triggers can change on a weekly basis.My symptoms have also begun to feel different; I no longer hyperventilate, but at times, it feels like my nerves go haywire — like lightning strikes my body. Sometimes, my hands and legs start shaking. Other times, panic attacks will take the form of a severe headache or aching limbs, with a roaring in my ears or abdominal pains and cramps. Despite the frustrations of living with panic attacks, I have seized the opportunity to become an expert on my own condition.Over time I’ve gotten better at identifying and coping with each type of panic attack. I always have an emergency kit with natural sedatives, like chamomile, at hand. I have learned that walking up and down the hallway often helps me to self-soothe and recenter. I’ve even established a kind of internal “reference book” containing the different types of attacks and the appropriate responses. I know exactly when drinking a glass of water and sitting on the sofa works — or when running around the school building a few times is best.Perhaps the most important step I have taken is learning to calm myself down. As a nine-year-old, I let my fears consume me. Now, I say to myself, \"Okay, Ella, you're having a panic attack now. Lie down, read a page in your book and then move on.” This kind of relaxing and letting go consciously takes practice — but it has dramatically changed my quality of life.Looking back, I would advise little Ella: \"Go on with your life. Find people you like and trust, talk to them.\" I’m fortunate to have my family — and I know not everyone has that support. But I hope that those who don’t have family support can talk to friends, school counselors or even a pet. Speaking thoughts out loud and validating your emotions (while realizing that your fears may not be real) is key.As I’ve navigated my recovery journey, I’ve continued to speak up about my experience. I want people to know that they are not alone. Recovery takes time and it is not always linear.Being vocal about my mental health gave me the chance to join a mental health startup called Earkick— an app designed to help people track their anxiety and better understand what coping mechanisms work best for them. As I reflected on my own journey, I realized that I had a chance to use my experience to help others.What began as a few phone calls eventually turned into my heart’s project. I love this work — figuring things out and tinkering with solutions. This app has also helped me personally; sometimes, when I’m having a panic attack, I do a voice recording on the app so I can listen to my thoughts and determine that my perceptions don’t necessarily represent reality. They are just thoughts, not facts. And I am not my thoughts.Ultimately, I want to go on to college and create a startup of my own. I’ve been through a lot, but I’m learning to make the best of it and use my experience to help others.Ella Mona is a 14-year-old student. In her free time, she works as Junior Product Manager for Earkick, a digital mental health startup. She has lived in Buenos Aires, San Francisco and Zurich with her parents and a younger brother.

      "body": "Young adulthood is a complex time marked by growing independence and personal responsibility. It is also a time of apprehension for both young people and their caregivers. For parents, it can be easy to write off their teens’ challenges during this time as “angst” or “just a part of growing up” — and they may not recognize serious distress or signs of an emerging mental illness. Recognizing and correcting this misstep is critical, particularly before teens go to college, which can be a high-risk time for many reasons.Understanding and appropriately anticipating mental health risks to college-bound teens is critical for parents to address any issues that arise. For those sending a child off to college, make sure to keep the following in mind.Perhaps the most proactive way to support your child’s mental health in college is to help them find the “right” school. This requires consideration of personal, emotional and social factors — including distance from home, size of the school, access and responsiveness of support services, the emotional-social climate on campus and your child’s personality and needs.When students find a school that aligns with their values and needs, they are more likely to reap the benefits of attending college: finding a passion, meeting new people and graduating with better career options. A poor college fit, however, is more likely trigger certain mental health issues. For teens who don’t know where to begin, The Jed Foundation offers an online quiz to help students assess fit.As a parent, your role is to encourage your children to fully assess their college options to find the school that will best support their social, emotional and academic needs. During college tours, you may want to learn about on-and off-campus mental health resources, including provider availability (especially given shortages and treatment options) and insurance coverage.You will also want to prepare your teens for college-related stressors they may experience, regardless of school fit. Discussing potential challenges — and highlighting that challenges are a common part of the college experience — is a good place to start.Given that 75% of mental illnesses begin by age 24, symptoms of mental health conditions may emerge during the college years. Unsurprisingly, then, more than 30% of college students were diagnosed or treated for anxiety, and 22% for depression, in the last 12 months.The emergence of symptoms often has an impact beyond emotional challenges; of the students diagnosed with depression or anxiety, more than 50% experience adverse academic impacts due to their condition. You can be proactive in supporting your children’s health by learning the warning signs of mental health conditions (depression and anxiety, in particular) which often include hopelessness, dramatic change in behavior and withdrawal or social isolation. Given the strong connection between mental health and academic performance, it can also be helpful for parents who are concerned about their child’s mental health to have access to grades under FERPA (which requires your child’s permission).Perhaps the most important way to support your child’s mental health is by providing emotional support. Young adults are most likely to succeed in their new environment if they’ve built self-esteem, self-worth, self-confidence and resilience — skills that you can help them build through affirmation and modeling healthy self-talk.A few approaches to model or teach this behavior include: demonstrating empathy and compassion, having and showing gratitude in response to challenges and reframing negative situations. Having these skills and knowing they have the support of their families will help students cope with other stressors, such as building relationships, academic pressures (which can be the greatest source of stress) and career planning.Other important skills you can help your child learn and develop during their college years, include independent living, smart decision-making about safety, time management and stress management.When you want to know more about your child’s life, especially if you’re concerned about their well-being, you’ll want to carefully assess what topics to bring up, how to bring them up and when to talk about them. Anticipating and discussing the stresses of on-campus life can be very helpful. For those who have a loved one living away from home, a communication contract can help. This agreement could include an agreed video call schedule and preset topics of discussion.Other ways to facilitate frequent communication include encouraging children to come home, having scheduled family get togethers and urging your children to maintain social connections with hometown friends, extended family members and even local counselors. Making on-campus visits also provides an opportunity to keep up.Ideally, you will have trusting relationships with your children that allow you to facilitate discussions regarding any concerns. A trusting relationship — one in which you can comfortably bring up mental health concerns — requires a solid foundation; You should reassure your children that you are “always there for them” if they would like to speak.If you notice any signs of distress or emerging mental illness, whether at home or on campus, you should reach out to your child. Calm, clear and honest communication is essential; give your child the opportunity to share their concerns first, and you’ll want to find common ground and explain your concerns. Naturally, these discussions may be difficult if your child is trying to assert their independence and maintain control. But establishing open communications and learning to compromise can be critical to healthy relationships.When your child leaves for school, you’ll want to have an idea of what resources and mentors will be available to them (and possibly your family). Nearly every university has a disabilities and accommodations office, which grants eligible students with disabilities accommodations that can facilitate the completion of school work. These include extra time to complete assignments and exams and tutoring. They also handle medical leave requests, should this be necessary.Parents and caregivers can play a critical role in noticing that their college student may be struggling. Most importantly, they will play a critical role in supporting their children through those mental health challenges to ensure they can flourish during the college years.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "Until I was 30 years old, I had I had never been to therapy before; I always thought I was someone who didn’t “need” to go to therapy — what did I have to talk to a therapist about?And until I was 30, I never told a soul that I had been sexually abused as a child. It never entered my consciousness that it was something I would say out loud — or even could verbalize.From the time I was 10 to about 12 and a half, my older brother molested me. I never told anyone about it because I was ashamed of what had happened; I was scared of the consequences of telling, and I didn’t have the words to explain what had happened. Most of all, I wanted to pretend like it had never happened.I buried so much of myself. I simply thought, Real men don't admit things like this. When I was in middle school and high school, I thought, you can never tell anyone — imagine all the terrible things that would happen if you did. The humiliation.Then, when I was 30 and had started a relationship with the woman who would later become my wife, thing started to change. We were having issues related to sex and intimacy, and she urged me to speak to a therapist.The intake form for that first therapist asked whether I had ever been the victim of neglect or physical, emotional or sexual abuse. I checked yes next to sexual abuse because I didn’t want to lie and then have it come up later in the sessions. I assumed I’d get in trouble. I brought up what happened in my first session, and the therapist thanked me for trusting her with that information, but I said I didn’t want to talk about it, because that’s not why I was there.A few months later, when she left her practice, she told me that, in her experience, someone who has been sexually abused as a child is bound to have that ripple out into all facets of their life, including their intimate relationships. She urged me to start widening the circle of people who knew.Shortly thereafter, I started seeing a new therapist who specializes in helping those who have experienced trauma, who I am still working with today. I gained more courage to tell others, including my then-girlfriend, my friends, family members and my parents (who, thankfully, believed me but expressed no interest or ability into delving into how and why this happened in our family).When I started my journey, I didn’t know that 1 in 13 boys (and 1 in 5 girls) are likely to experience child sexual abuse. I thought there must have been something different about me, something wrong with me specifically. I felt isolated, scared and ashamed.In the years since I first started processing my trauma, I have come to recognize many things about the abuse and about myself. I didn’t do anything wrong. Someone wronged me, hurt me and betrayed me. I did not have the emotional wherewithal or vocabulary to tell anyone about the abuse at the time, and it is completely normal and understandable for children not to tell.I also had the incredible opportunity to participate in a group therapy setting in the fall of 2019 with five other men who were also sexually abused as children. We talked about the persistent stigma surrounding men disclosing that they were sexually abused as children.We discussed how our culture still largely sends the message to men that you cannot be a “real man” if you admit to being abused, or that you’ll somehow be thought of as “less than” or weak. And we discussed how, while we were all in different places in our healing journeys, we could relate to each other’s feelings about the abuse, our masculinity and our senses of self.Men who have been sexually abused are not “less than” men who have not been abused. They are not defective. They are full human beings who have been through the crucible of trauma. They deserve compassion and support, not ostracism or scorn. I feel such a deep connection to that group of survivors. Those men are warriors.In addition to regular therapy (including, recently, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing therapy), I’ve sought to heal through creative writing and poetry. Writing helped me process and come to terms with the abuse. My debut poetry collection, “How to Bury a Boy at Sea,” was published in April. I hope it can be used as a healing tool for survivors, their loved ones, therapists and educators. Most importantly, I hope it helps other survivors, and men especially, feel less alone and more understood.There are, unfortunately, many more of us out there than other survivors likely know. And there are so many incredible people, resources and organizations, including NAMI, that can help if you decide you are ready to seek it. The more men who come forward and speak about child sexual abuse, the less power the social stigma holds. I’m glad I stopped being silent, because I realized I had nothing to be ashamed of. Being abused is something horrible that happened to me — it is not who I am.To all who have been abused, and men especially, I urge you to talk with someone about what happened — if and when you feel comfortable. I want you to know that you are not alone. \n\n\nPhil Goldstein is a poet, journalist and content marketer.

      "body": "The mental health of today’s young people is reaching crisis levels.A recent CDC survey discovered that 37% of U.S. high school students reported regular mental health struggles during the COVID-19 pandemic. According to The Trevor Project, 45% of LGBTQ youth seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year. The American Academy of Pediatrics, the Children’s Hospital Association and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry recently declared this crisis a national emergency.As the mental health conversation has evolved, schools have become at the forefront of mental health initiatives. 30% of all students who receive mental health services find that support in schools  — making our education system the most accessed mental health delivery system by children and adolescents.As schools and universities rush to keep up with the increasing demand for mental health resources, students say that what’s currently being offered at school to address mental health is not enoughIn our new study from Springtide Research Institute that surveyed over 3,000 students and interviewed 80 more, students said their schools often provide “performative,” “inconsistent” and “reactive” mental health interventions — like providing support dogs during finals week — but fail to sustain a mental-health friendly culture at school that supports students consistently.“In my university context, performative mental-health resources, especially those that aren’t long-term, do more harm than good,” explained Lana, a 22-year-old university student. “Bringing in dogs to pet at the library during finals does not address the core element of why students have an uptick in hotline calls from stress and anxiety during finals and the weeks leading up to them.” She went on to say, “Therapy dogs aren’t going to solve that. We need consistent mental health resources that address how academia is structured to make students stressed.”Students also expressed frustration that school initiatives don’t address the underlying reasons for stress — namely, the stressors that come from school.Julie, a 17-year-old high school student, explained, “Even guidance counselors at school will be like, ‘Oh, is everything okay? Oh no, it’s not? Well, I’ll help you, but you have to get a good grade on your test because you don’t want your grades suffering.’” Julie explained that what students need is “somebody to talk to who’s going to help us — who doesn’t have any motive besides just wanting us to get better. Our guidance counselors, even though they’re great, they have that mode of like, ‘Okay, how are we going to pass those classes?’”Additionally, students say their schools seem to encourage the pressure to achieve constant success and to be perpetually busy for the singular goal of getting into college. Sophie, Sofia and Acadia, all high school students, told Springtide they are rarely encouraged to pursue goals and activities that aren’t directly related to college ambitions.“We are expected to do clubs, sports, AP classes, college classes and work, all so that we can get into a good college,” they said in a combined statement. “At times, it seems that schools’ systems push the idea of college and career so much that they forget to tend to students’ hearts and souls.”A major issue with school initiatives to address mental health is that they often fail to address the systemic nature of the mental health crisis. What is currently happening in most schools, students say, is crisis response, when what's really needed is crisis prevention.This doesn’t negate the importance of crisis response; schools and educators place focus there for good reason. However, the problem arises when schools simply default to a crisis response that is “inconsistent, and frankly, doing more for the university’s image than the well-being of their students,” Lana, a 22-year-old university student, explained.We must expand the conversation from the individual — that is, moving away from asking what one person can be doing differently to improve their own mental health — and begin to address the issue as a collective concern: What can organizations, groups and schools specifically do to better support the mental health of their young people?As sociologists, we know our role is not to do the work of therapists, teachers, counselors, etc. Instead, our work is to shine light on what young people are telling us. When it comes to the resources and tools they need to thrive in their mental health, we noticed a few themes.Students thrive when schools promote deep social connections. These connections engender a sense of belonging for young people, which is essential to their mental wellness. Springtide has identified that a sense of belonging requires that young people feel noticed, named and known. Teachers play a special role here: Students who had a meaningful interaction with a teacher or professor were significantly less likely to feel lonely at school.Students need to have achievable expectations and the tools they need to meet those expectations. A school cannot authentically say they prioritize mental health if they are giving their students enough homework to keep them up past midnight to get the grades they desire. Schools needs to take a proactive approach to curriculum design so that teachers can get the best out of their students academically while accepting their mental health needs.Schools have an opportunity to create a sense of purpose in young people. There’s a prevailing sense among young people that their purpose at school is to get good grades. But fostering purpose at school also means encouraging young people to find their connection to something bigger than themselves —what they want to accomplish, who they want to become and how they want to make a difference. Students discovering a bigger purpose at school, we found, are more likely to say they’re “flourishing a lot” in their mental health.If schools commit to fostering a mental-health friendly culture that deepens social connections, provides the tools students need to meet achievable expectations and promotes a sense of purpose in young people — they will be better equipped to prevent mental health crises and enable all students to thrive.Kevin Singer is Head of Media and Public Relations at Springtide Research Institute and a professor at two community colleges.Sam Ludlow-Broback is a Media Relations Intern for Springtide Research Institute.Springtide Research Institute’s report, “Mental Health & Gen Z: What Educators Need to Know,” is available for purchase here.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "It wasn’t just the number of questions the boy asked, but the way he asked them.I was speaking to a packed auditorium of seventh and eighth graders about my first novel, “Under a War-torn Sky.” I was new to school author visits then, but I’d already grown accustomed to the urgency of book-loving 13-year-old boys, eager to show off their knowledge of the aircrafts referenced in my book. Like so many young people that age, this student’s face was a magical mixture of child and on-the-cusp adult, all earnest, itchy energy.But this was different — beyond smart-student literary insight. He kept asking about my hero’s father, a prototypical, Great-Depression-era, tough-love farmer. Why was he so harsh? Had my protagonist done something to deserve it? And just like my hero anguishes: did that father really love his son, given how hard he pushed him?I exchanged a glance with his teacher who nodded a promise she’d follow up. When she did, the student opened up about his dad and what turned out to be a case of PTSD and depression.Building awareness and understanding of mental health has long been a \"mission\" of mine, first as a senior writer with the Washingtonian magazine, then as a historical/biographical fiction writer.As a journalist, I’d had the extraordinarily rewarding and humbling experience of hearing from people who’d sought therapeutic help after reading my articles recounting the struggles of individuals who’d lived the issue and survived.But that student taught me the power of a well-told novel.After many years of writing, I’ve learned that that a character’s emotional journey can speak to an unnamed uneasiness within young readers’ hearts. Novels with accurate, sensitive presentations of mental health issues can provide a fictionalized, safe distance for youth to recognize challenges they’re facing themselves and talk about them thematically rather than in a personal or confessional way. This, in turn, allows for a less self-conscious discussion, in addition to providing clear clues to adults that a child might need help.I wrote my latest work, “Louisa June and the Nazis in the Waves,” during the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic, as we grappled with its unforeseen, deadly threat. As a historical fiction writer, I’ve learned the power of presenting issues in a past era rather than present day — it removes the heat of immediacy, lowering readers’ defensive, self-protective guardrails.As I was writing, Nazi U-boats suddenly trolling our coastline became a metaphor for the lightning quick aspect of the terrifying pandemic my readers were experiencing firsthand. Life turns on a dime for my protagonist Louisa June as she faces the out-of-the-blue death of her beloved brother — a  devastating loss similar to the unanticipated illness or death of immediate or secondary caregivers (parents, grandparents, extended family) which an estimated 1.5 million children under the age of 18 are currently grappling with because of COVID, according to the NIH.My hope is that “Louisa June” resonates with readers facing their own loss — that they find hope and reassurance in Louisa June’s strength and journey to healing. Also, that their friends, who were luckier, find sympathy and understanding of the grieving process.This book carries an additional undercurrent about emotional health and depression in family members — which can be a different thing entirely from grief, of course. Says Louisa June: “My mama has the melancholy. But recently it’s gone from her customary pinkish-gray — like a dawn mist in the marshes, still hopeful and able to clear into bright blue with the right sprinkle of sunshine — to thick, storm-surge purple black.”An estimated one in five children live with a depressed parent, many of whom, tragically, go untreated. My goal is to have “Louisa June” help tweens in similar situations to feel seen and understood. To be encouraged by the supportive example of LJ’s elderly Cousin Belle to ask adults they trust for help, especially in this time of increased mental health struggles.In England, bibliotherapy — the process of reading, reflecting on and discussing literature to encourage a cognitive shift — is a respected treatment option akin to music or art therapy. Studies show that people who read regularly are more able to empathize with others, but the effects of a good book are even more wide-reaching. In the mayhem of day-to-day life, we may forget what we felt in English class when reading a novel in which we saw ourselves and therein found a sense of communion. That wonderment Charlie expresses in “The Perks of Being a Wallflower”: “It's strange because sometimes, I read a book, and I think I am the people in the book.”Learning expert Rachael Walker created a discussion guide using “Louisa June” as a springboard for discussing emotional wellness with students. I recommend using this tool to encourage children’s creativity while they process complex feelings. I particularly love the art project playing off the poetic nature of Louisa June’s lost brother, his ability to find uplifting moments of beauty even in life’s darker moments.Following his example, even though Nazi U-boats lurk in the waves, Louisa June thinks on the stars reflection in the water, a life-preserver reminder that “something beautiful and mystical, something uplifting, floated there, too.” The exercise encourages students to identify what “stars in the waves” elevate them and help them cope, then pin them on posters of turbulent waves.L.

      "body": "Generally, anger is a natural response to distressing issues or situations — yet, it is often felt or expressed in ways that are scary, confusing or even unhealthy. As a result, we often consider anger to be a “bad” emotion, and we view its expression as destructive. Accordingly, experiencing anger can be difficult for both children and adults.Naturally, anger is a feeling most people prefer not to experience. But when we understand anger, it can become a healing, transformative and empowering force. Anger in children can be a response to a situation that's in need of a solution. It can alert others that more love, safety or protection is needed. Anger in a child can help them learn more about their own needs and self-care or how to vent feelings of frustration. Anger does not have to be a negative experience.Most children require guidance, support and instruction as they learn to identify and regulate their anger. It’s not always easy for little ones to understand feeling mad. What we don't want to do as adults is to stigmatize or present anger as a bad emotion to feel or express. We want to encourage children to be mindful about their frustrations — why they occur, how to express them and what they can do to problem solve.You can explain to little ones that anger is an emotion that arises when we feel frustrated, disappointed or hurt. Teach them that anger is something adults and children feel — even babies, too. Help them understand that anger is a natural reaction, but there are ways for it to be expressed in healthy and unhealthy ways.Anger can be expressed in adaptive ways (mindful words and problem solving) or maladaptive ways (yelling, getting physical or being aggressive). Helping children to understand healthy expressions of anger will give them self-confidence, teach them positive social interactions and encourage them to self-regulate confusing emotions. Remind children to \"Use your words\" when anger presents. This will help little ones move away from using physicality, like breaking toys, hitting or other aggressive behaviors to express anger.When your child shows maladaptive anger, you can redirect them by prompting, “Instead of throwing your toys, tell me what’s bothering you.” “Instead of hitting your brother, tell him what’s making you mad.” Make sure you praise the adaptive expression of anger so your child can feel good about their choices and you can reinforce that behavior.It’s important to help children understand why they are angry. Encourage them to identify what the situation is that’s made them react. What need is not being met? Who or what is frustrating them? This helps children construct a mindful view of anger and why it's happening.You’ll also want to teach your children ways to problem solve their anger. Does the situation need a compromise? “Maybe you and your brother can take turns playing with the swing.” Do they need boundaries? “I know you’re angry that it’s getting late, and we have to leave the park. You can choose only one more ride at the park before we go home, or we can go home now. What would you like to do?” Or is your child’s anger from fatigue, hunger or sleepiness? “Do you think you’re hungry for a snack? Or you’re sleepy? Could that be why you’re mad right now?”Make sure you take the time to model these strategies whenever you can. When you show your child your own angry feelings, how you express them in healthy ways and problem solve the situation to reduce your anger, you reinforce their evolving skillset.Ultimately, anger is an emotion that can be difficult for children to understand and experience. With guidance from adults, little ones can learn how to identify irritability, express it in adaptive ways and determine that “being mad” can lead to meaningful outcomes.Dr. Deborah Serani is a psychologist and author of “Sometimes When I'm Mad” by Free Spirit Publishing.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Mental health — and mental illness specifically — can be very difficult to understand and navigate for anyone, but especially for children. Children, more so than adults, have difficulty processing emotions and psychological changes. As a result, they often exhibit behavioral challenges when they don’t fully understand their emotional state. I noticed this with my own children; when my kids were younger, they would get frustrated and throw tantrums because they couldn't articulate their feelings.I often think back to my childhood and my experience with mental illness. When I was younger, I would experience panic attacks and depressive episodes. But back then, I didn’t know what they were. I assumed they were simply a part of life, and I carried on like everything was ok. As a result, I wasn’t properly diagnosed with a mental health condition until I was well into my twenties.I didn’t want my kids to have the same experience of confusion and uncertainty, so I took it upon myself to have open conversations about mental health with them. Here are some of the things I did to make the topic more accessible.One of the things I found most beneficial when discussing mental health with my family was to help my kids label what they were feeling. The Georgetown University Center for Child and Human Development recommends making or drawing facial expressions for young children and asking them to guess what emotion you’re trying to portray. This allows children to visualize and explore complex emotions in an accessible way. This is an especially helpful activity to do with younger children who don’t yet have the vocabulary to articulate their emotions. During interactive play with my children, we incorporate these types of exchanges to help them become more familiar with emotions.I also found that telling my kids stories at bedtime was a good way to explore their emotions. Oftentimes, they would be able to connect with what the different characters were experiencing — so when they couldn’t say exactly what they were feeling, they would be able to tell me which character they felt like.While discussing mental health with young children is an intimidating task, finding ways to demonstrate, label and unpack specific feelings sets them up to find better coping mechanisms and strategies.As many parents know, children often learn by imitating the people around them. I first noticed this when my son began repeating some of the words I would say. He would copy the way his dad reacts when watching sports. This kind of behavior was cute. However, I also noticed that when he was sad, he would try to hide in a corner, far away from everyone else. When he was scared, he would let his emotions take over him instead of coming to us for help.I eventually realized that my son was mirroring our behavior. When I had panic attacks, I would often “ride out the wave” instead of practicing grounding techniques. If I had a depressive episode, I would shut everyone out and “deal with it” on my own. Amy Morin, psychotherapist and author of “13 Things Mentally Strong People Don't Do,” notes that the habits we cannot break often hold us from true success and happiness. Indulging in self-pity, for instance, can hold us back. While I knew this in theory, seeing my son do the same things opened my eyes to the fact that I had to take better care of myself to show him how he can navigate difficult emotions.From then on, I paid close attention to my own behavior and developed coping mechanisms. I found that watching comfort movies helped when I was in a bad state and being around people I love made me feel more at ease when I was anxious. Slowly but surely, my son started to cope in these ways as well. Now, both my children come to us when they are struggling. By caring for myself, I have taught my children to prioritize self-care and asking for help.Mental health can be an unfamiliar or sensitive topic, even for young children. Often, this discomfort keeps children from expressing their feelings or asking for help. I found that cultivating a safe space at home, as advised by UNICEF, helped my children feel like they were free to express their emotions and feel heard without judgment. Moreover, this foundation will help them to grow up with fewer doubts about seeking help for their mental health. I always try my best to listen and validate what my kids are feeling by listening, accepting and offering advice if they ask for it.A safe space can also include check-ins to establish trust and communication. I would take my son out for a drive (so he would feel safe doing a familiar activity), and we would talk about what problems he was facing that week. Even when there weren’t any, he felt heard and understood, and I had reassurance that he was ok.With my younger daughter, I took her to parks where she would tell me about her day while I pushed her on the swings. This made the interaction feel more casual and inviting, which encouraged her to share more. However, it is important that when you are attempting this with your kids, you should not push boundaries or force them to speak when they are uncomfortable. Cultivating a safe space means there is no pressure.As the mental health conversation evolves, it's time for more people to get comfortable with (and diligent about) addressing this topic with their kids. Judith Warner, journalist and bestselling author of “And Then They Stopped Talking to Me: Making Sense of Middle School,” points out that most modern parents are increasingly aware of mental health issues because they grew up with other people talking about them, which lessened the stigma surrounding mental health and helped promote interventions.These conversations are essential for our children’s health and eventually, the direction of societal attitudes about mental health. By taking an open, proactive and empathetic approach, I have been able to teach my children how to recognize and handle emotions, but also how to feel confident addressing mental health head-on.Alicia Maddox is a mental health advocate who is working toward a graduate degree in psychology.

      "body": "This past Christmas, my husband gave me a journal to write down my dreams, goals and daily meditations. I filled almost every page, but I didn’t write about my dreams or goals. Instead, I wrote apologies to my son. I wrote so much that my hands needed ice packs. I dug down deep. I went through the ink of two pens. Apologies are like the decision to paint your house pink — go big or go home.Then I wrapped a sparkly bow around the journal and headed to a coffee shop to meet my estranged son, who is 21 years old. He’s not a little boy anymore; he is now on his own, living his life in a city far away from me. And he hates me for missing his cries for mental health help when he was growing up. By missing these signs, he says, I disciplined him harshly for things he could not control — and, in turn, warped his sense of self.Deep breaths, I reminded myself. Because this was hard. I hadn’t heard from him in two years, but it had been at least three since I’d recognized him. Somewhere around the time he turned 20, I saw a complete personality change. Parts of him that used to seem like eccentric traits we could make room for, now seemed cruel. His eyes changed, and where they once held the kindness of a little boy, now held the decisions of a man.I waited in the coffee shop for him. He was late. Again. Then he came. At least he came.Thin, I thought. He still looked thin. I wondered if he still forgot to eat.We did not embrace. It had been two years, after all.This meeting brought up complex feelings because my son was not the only one in pain. Underneath my unconditional love for my son lies the trauma of raising him. After all, I’m human, too.And it was hard. He was hard.According to everyone, my son was a troublemaker. He had quirks that people deemed distasteful: His hyper fixation on things, his hygiene issues, the not sleeping enough, the sleeping too much, the piano playing that went on all day long.Moreover, I didn’t want to hand my child over to the trained professionals — people who I didn’t know and who didn’t love him. Because I was afraid they would hurt him, not help him. Because I thought I knew best.I didn’t miss his cries for help, as my son claims; I heard them. But I thought love would be enough to address his challenges. I thought a happy family, good schools, healthy foods, piano lessons, a fluffy dog and family who cared would be enough. But this approach ignored some painful realities.So why didn’t I get my own son the help he needed?Images of what could happen to my son if I reached out for help for him ranged from giant orderlies with menacing smiles who would overly restrain him with straight jackets to doctors who would drug him and destroy his brilliant mind.“I’m sorry for raising you in the Baptist Church,” I had written in the journal. “I’m sorry for every pastor who ever told you that you were bad. I’m sorry for the days I spanked you instead of held you. I’m sorry for not getting you the help you needed, and for what that did to your sense of self. I’m sorry for everything that ever made you believe you were bad, weird, stupid or flawed, when you were just a kid who needed help.”I watched him read the journal and hoped, once again, that love was enough. He took his time reading it, about two hours, and considered every word. He closed it and thanked me for writing it and said he would never forget where he came from, or all the good we did for him, but that I was a bug. I was a brain eating bug, who crawls around the earth eating his brain with my venom.  I quietly said, “I’m so sorry.” And I got up and left him there because there was nothing more I could say.We’ve come so far in our discussion and understanding about mental health in the last 20 years. What I can say now is that I am so sorry for the scars on his heart that have my name on them. I tried to be the orderly, the doctor, the nurse, the therapist, the teacher and the coach. But maybe, just maybe, had I trusted and sought out available help for him, I wouldn’t have needed to fill an entire journal with apologies. And maybe one day he will have the heart to forgive me.Lisa Campbell is a nurse practitioner and writer.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "It was early fall, just past the autumnal equinox, that the fires started. Winds pushed flames through the sunburnt, thirsty hills of Southern California, and it was the ash — gray flakes floating like snowflakes covering the surface of the earth — that I remember most clearly. I remember my own mental state much less clearly. Amid the fires, my mind was ablaze, and reality was slipping away at exponential speed as my first weeks of high school came and passed. Yet, I did not have the recognition nor the language to describe my illness at the time.I felt as though my mind’s ties to reality were cut — and it was there, in a state of confused limbo, that I did not question the day when the high school secretary called over the PA system for Alexandra Shall to come to the office. My mom told me I would be spending “a few days of rest” in the hospital. For some, such a proposition might have evoked fear; but for me, the ability to lay in a bed, as I imagined, sounded divine.The neuropsychiatric institute was not a bed, and it was not a few days. The intake included an excruciating litany of questions. The physical exam, unwanted. Hours later, I sat on a bed dressed in a thin white blanket, clothes and sanitary pads laid bare next to me, much as I felt. The next five weeks were terrifying, and, as I would learn, they came to define the course my life would take over the coming years — the years until now, at the age of 33.There are remnants I recall during the course of my six hospitalizations from October 2013 to June 2014: when I was moved to the bed across from the nurses’ station due to safety concerns; when I was confined to bed for three days for repeated incidents of self-harm within the hospital; when my roommate played explicit rap music loudly in the middle of the night to help her sleep while it forced me to stay awake; when I watched another patient have a seizure on the volleyball court after starting an antidepressant; when, for five weeks, I ate a small piece of fried chicken breast and two scoops of mashed potatoes every night for dinner, both of which proved catastrophic for my digestion; playing cards and ping pong with psych techs and other patients as if our circumstances were ordinary and not of concern; when I saw a psych tech sneak one of my Reese’s Peanut Butter cups from the patient belongings cabinet in the kitchen; watching my little mini dixie cup of pills increase in fullness as the weeks and months passed.During my first hospitalization, I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. Years later, my symptoms would be reclassified as bipolar 1 disorder, rapid cycling with mixed episodes. To describe this period of my life as “an adolescence, interrupted” is quite an understatement. Every thread in the fabric of my life changed.While my teen years felt like being shuffled through a revolving door of hospitalizations and medications, the experiences I had and the emotions I felt were transformative, and not something I would trade, even considering the pain.Early on, I developed a deep empathy — an ability to understand the pain of others, whether it be physical, mental or emotional. Mental illness is not a solitary experience; rather it affects individuals, families and loved ones. Learning to come to a place of peace, love and forgiveness is healing on all ends.For children and teens with mental health conditions, the road to recovery may be short or it may be long. It is unpredictable, and no one can claim to foresee what comes ahead; so much of life is unknown. Learning to live with discomfort, to find happiness within that discomfort and to approach life from a place of empathy for yourself and others can be sources of strength as you walk the path toward recovery.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "My seven-year-old daughter Isla has big emotions. There is nothing wrong with that, but sometimes, as any parent would, I worry about her worries.Isla becomes anxious before big events (normal) or when being separated from me and my husband (also normal), but this year I started to notice some behavioral changes that signaled something more serious than everyday worries.Once, she sneaked food out of the pantry to eat alone, which worried me because I have an eating disorder. She also began to beg to stay home from school almost every day, and sometimes, these moments would turn into huge crying fits during which she screamed at me. When she went to school, she ended up in the nurse’s office every day until her teacher wouldn’t give her a pass.When her teacher talked to me, I stiffened up. When I was younger, a bit older than Isla now, I would go to the nurse’s office. I wasn’t sick, but I knew that by asking, I could have my mom or grandmother take me home. The nurse called my mom one day and said she thought I had school phobia, a term used for an anxious child who refuses to go to school or avoids school. It turns out that nurse was on to something — I did have a mental health condition (later, I would learn that my behaviors were symptoms of depression and anxiety).As the concerning behavior continued, I asked my therapist about getting help for Isla, and eventually, I was able to get her an appointment with a play therapist, who would be able to communicate with and evaluate Isla through play. I believed my daughter was exhibiting signs of a classic case of anxiety.During our appointment, the therapist asked me, “Do you think this is Isla’s anxiety or possibly your anxiety you’re projecting on to her?”I answered her right away: “Yes, 100%.” I’m so scared that my kids will inherit my mental health conditions, that I have begun to overanalyze their behavior. I can’t help it.The play therapist then told me it was too early to worry based on Isla’s history, and that kids tend to repeat behaviors that have a favorable outcome like coming home after a trip to the nurse — so the repeated nurse’s office visits weren’t necessarily a concern. I accepted this answer. It made sense, especially coming from a trained professional.Despite the therapist’s reassurance, I started to worry about my daughter again. Was I projecting? Or was something wrong?It took a lot of thinking, but finally, I arrived at what was really bothering me.I was worried Isla would turn out like me, meaning she would struggle with multiple mental health conditions. I feared that she might have to fight hard for the right medications and appropriate therapies — that she would have to fight for anything at all.My fears also stemmed from my concerns about how the pandemic has affected my children. They are under an enormous amount of stress, and I feel like they’ve been shortchanged; in many ways, they’ve had to grow up quickly as they absorbed the trauma of a global disaster.The pandemic’s effect on this generation’s childhoods is simply unfair. And this upheaval has compounded an already existing youth mental health crisis.While I hold resentments about how my own childhood mental health situation was handled, I can use it as motivation to do better for the next generation. I can’t go back and change things, but what I can do is advocate for both my children. I try hard not to overanalyze and worry about Isla and my son, but the worrying never stops when you’re a parent, especially a parent with anxiety. Still, I owe them my best efforts.Part of this effort includes remembering that Isla isn’t me. Just because I struggled at a young age doesn’t mean she will. Sometimes, I think that maybe I went through those years to be able to help Isla. If nothing else, I know how to be an advocate and prioritize self-care.Maybe my daughter won’t have any mental health conditions. Maybe she’ll have a care-free childhood (post-COVID-19) and learn how to tolerate distress. If she does develop a mental health condition, it’s out of my control, and I’m not at fault. All I can do is be the best parent I can, be supportive of my kids, teach them healthy coping skills and hope for the best.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "In 1995, when I was a 30-year-old basketball coach at the University of Maine, I received a diagnosis that changed my life forever. After living with bipolar disorder, and overcoming its hurdles for the last 26 years, I have come to recognize the importance of support, community and, more recently, the opportunity for advocacy.It is no secret that we have a lot to address when it comes to the mental health challenges and the needs of our population. These issues are evident at every level of our society. High-profile stories involving Naomi Osaka, Simone Biles and Calvin Ridley this year, each of whom took a timeout to address their own mental health battles, demonstrate how mental illness can impact anyone — across all spectrums of race, gender and economic status — and in any place, time or circumstances.After witnessing the devastating effects of untreated mental illness, I stepped aside from the basketball arena, and I decided to become a different type of coach: one devoted to fighting the stigmas surrounding mental illness. Here are my thoughts on how to fight change the conversation about mental health.We can transform societal attitudes about mental illness early on. Indeed, mental health has the potential to be part of a wider core curriculum. As a former coach, I would love to see classes in mental wellness and training in suicide prevention become common and required coursework in the way that physical education has been for over a century.This could include broader range of psychology courses and health courses added to departments’ offerings. I would also hope to see educators proactively teaching about mental illness as a subject matter; this approach would allow young people to have an understanding of mental health conditions beyond surface-level familiarity.Personally, I enjoyed engaging students through several coaching philosophies and principles. Immediacy, intelligence and intensity are tools commonly used by professionally trained therapists that can help teach young people to prioritize their mental health. By encouraging students to think in the present, to manage and express their feelings and to be bold in sharing their experiences, coaches can empower their players to take ownership of their emotional well-being.College campuses are currently ground zero for discussion and debate on how to approach mental health. Suicide is the second-leading cause of death among college students in the U.S.On campus, some of the most impactful and influential people are coaches, professors and mentors. These positions can come up with innovative ways to reach our peers, players or students to encourage them to share what may be troubling them and to seek professional help when they it.Mentoring relationships can help young people who feel alone by providing reassurance and safe spaces to explore new ideas and grow without fear of judgement.So, what can you do? It is important that we demand greater resources, not just on campuses, but also for underserved communities struggling with their own battles. We must continue to educate lawmakers about mental health programs, push for greater funding in budgets and lobby insurance companies to recognize mental health treatments more widely.And how do we help people who are struggling with their mental health?We must find ways to be open and honest about our experiences — and, in turn, we must be able to listen the stories of other lived experiences without judgement. Changing our individual behavior to model the changes we want to see is a necessary first step. Moreover, we must not be afraid to act, sometimes swiftly, to get help for someone in need.Philosophy matters. Choice, not chance, will and must determine the future conversation surrounding mental illness. We must make different choices in our education system to teach a topic that all students will encounter in their lives.\n\nJoanne P.

      "body": "It is not uncommon for people to have an experience where they are left feeling distressed. Oftentimes, the event can be so traumatizing that it causes us to feel stressed for days, weeks, months — and sometimes even years — after it took place.Traumatic stress can manifest in a few ways emotionally, physically and mentally. Accordingly, it’s important to know what it can look like in these three different forms.If you have experienced a traumatic event, and are grappling with traumatic stress, your emotions may become extremely intensified. This could include: having frequent anger outbursts, the onset of panic attacks or even feelings of great sadness and loss.Another way traumatic stress manifests emotionally is when people disconnect from their emotions entirely and feel numb to new events or stimuli. This is a protective response to prevent their nervous system from getting overloaded.Due to heightened emotions, one may experience physical symptoms of traumatic stress. This can appear in a variety of ways throughout the body. Some people may experience shallow or rapid breathing, chest pain or headaches. Others report having tense muscles or feeling tense throughout the body or find themselves restless and having difficulty relaxing and sitting still.While some people feel physical tension or pain throughout the body, this is not the case for everyone. Some may find themselves on the opposite of the spectrum; oftentimes, people find themselves feeling completely physically disconnected.It's not uncommon for someone experiencing traumatic stress to zone out and feel as though they are not connected to their physical body or the world around them. This can also be accompanied by a dulling of the five senses (smell, touch, taste, hearing and sight). Some individuals feel as if their bodies are weightless — or they  experience lightheadedness and dizziness.Traumatic stress also impacts how we feel cognitively. When experiencing symptoms of traumatic stress mentally, one may have racing thoughts focused on the present (and how to navigate the traumatic situation), the future (due to their vision of now being doubted) or towards whatever is causing them traumatic stress.Alternatively, one may have brain fog and not be able to access words or thoughts. This may look like an individual being very confused or experiencing some memory loss. Some people have difficulty describing or recognizing their emotions. This is the brain’s way of trying to protect the body. It will try to shut down any “unnecessary” activity in order to focus on scanning for danger and safety.When experiencing traumatic stress, it is important to relax and ground your mind and body to make yourself feel safe. Utilizing grounding or mindfulness techniques or interventions help regulate the body and send messages to the brain saying, “I am safe.” Practicing these interventions allow the brain and body to focus on the present moment instead of the past traumatic experience that is causing us stress. NAMI offers several strategies to help individuals cope with traumatic stress. Some effective methods include:5 - Look: Look around for five things you can see and say them out loud.4 - Feel: Pay attention to your body, think of four things you can feel and say them out loud.3 - Listen: Listen for three things you can hear (traffic, birds chirping, etc.) and say them out loud.2 - Smell: Say two things you can smell. If you can't smell anything at the moment, name your two favorite smells out loud.1 - Taste: Say one thing you taste. If you can't taste anything, name your favorite thing to taste.Breathe in through your nose to a count of four. Hold it for two. Breathe out slowly through your mouth for a count of six. By doing this you are activating the part of your nervous system that helps your body calm itself.Ultimately, traumatic stress can have a lasting impact on us. It can affect our brains, bodies and how we respond to stressors after a traumatic event — on an emotional, physical and mental level. These manifestations of traumatic stress can range from mild to severe, but regardless of intensity, symptoms can be managed. If you are struggling, try utilizing grounding techniques and mindfulness activities to cope and move forward.Brent Metcalf is a Licensed Clinical Social Worker practicing at Tri-Star Counseling, LLC in Johnson City, Tenn.

      "body": "The other day, I was out at a restaurant, and I heard a table of people discussing high blood pressure. It started when someone said they had gone to the doctor that day and learned they had high blood pressure. Another person said, “I do too,” and named the medication their doctor prescribed. A third person at their table added that their father had high blood pressure, determined to be a symptom of heart disease — and now he is eating better and exercising.So, why are we not hearing these dinnertime conversations about mental health?The reason we don’t often hear conversations about mental health and mental illness is because many people are uncomfortable addressing the topic. It is normal to be concerned about, or even afraid of, things that are uncertain or unfamiliar. But if we take the time to learn about mental health, and the prevalence of mental illness, we will all feel more comfortable talking about it. Perspective is key.To get a better understanding of how mental illness is present in our lives (whether we know it or not), I like to offer the following example: When you are in a public place or space you frequent often, like your church or a store, look around you. Statistically, one in five of the people you see may have dealt with anxiety, depression or other mental health conditions in the last year. Someone you may have seen every week for years may have mental illness, and you would not even know it.Another reason we don’t hear dinner-table conversations about mental health comes down to a lack of education and awareness. Many people experience mental health conditions, but often invalidate their own experiences, or are unaware that what they are experiencing is a symptom of mental illness.I have heard people say, “Oh, I don’t have a mental health condition, I just have some anxiety,” or, “I’ve just been down lately.” Of course, some experiences consistent with mental illness are simply normal reactions to difficult circumstances, but at what point do these feelings become symptoms and signal a need for treatment? Education about when feelings and behaviors need medical attention will be a critical step in changing the conversation. More people will get the help they need when they understand their own bodies and minds.Ultimately, we must remember that mental health is health. Mental health conditions, like high blood pressure, are treatable medical conditions. People with mental illness can — and do — live normal and very productive lives. A quick glance at the news will remind us of this; many successful CEOs, Olympic athletes, famous entertainers and prolific artists live with mental health conditions and continue to achieve their goals and find happiness.May is Mental Health Awareness Month. Let’s take it upon ourselves to learn the facts about mental health. Let’s challenge ourselves to examine our beliefs and educate ourselves.I’d like to encourage people to use this awareness month to start a discussion with someone. You can start a conversation by saying:If we hope to move forward and reach a place where we no longer have to envision 767 buses of preventable tragedies, we need to make changes. Mental health conditions are treatable, and by shedding light on the realities of mental health and showing compassion, we can improve (and perhaps even save) lives!Amy Payne is the Executive Director of The Gathering Place, a peer-run recovery center in Green Bay, Wis.

      "body": "Recently I was watching one of my favorite movies, “A Few Good Men.” I had been a fan of the movie, a legal drama about marines, even before I joined the army. It features incredible performances from its A-list cast and a good “twist and turn” storyline. At one point in the movie, two marines participate in a hazing incident in which they are ordered to put a tainted rag down another marine’s throat and tape his mouth shut.As I watched, in my mind, I was transported back to a night in the desert when I was in the army, and I had a similar, horrible experience. I try not to dwell on this traumatic event in my life. I quickly turned off the television, but the thoughts of my own encounter came roaring back, and I found myself experiencing the incident all over again.Even when my trauma first happened, it was so profound, I did not know how to manage it. What I experienced was the last thing I imagined I would endure during my service. Even retelling the story spurs racing thoughts and a mountain of anxiety: I felt the tight restraint of duct tape being wrapped around my body until I was lying on the ground, unable to move in any direction to defend myself against my fellow soldiers. The duct tape was strapped across my mouth, and I was having difficulty breathing.I remember thinking, “how could this be happening to me?” I was sure I was experiencing the last moments of my life. My parents flashed across my mind — would they ever know the truth about what had happened to me in this desolate, lonely place?Seeing the hazing incident in a movie brought about a PTSD flashback. I looked down at the bracelet on my left wrist. It had the phone number of the veteran’s crisis line. Maybe they could help?I also remembered that I had planned and prepared for a situation like this. Because of my diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, I developed a routine I could follow on stressful days or days when I am experiencing PTSD symptoms. I knew that keeping to my routine was crucial. With the past weighing heavy on my entire body, the part of the body that was taped, I still had to move forward for the rest of the day. My daily routine was the only way I could move on.I began by having coffee while listening to uplifting music. I brushed my teeth. Those two small steps made me proud that I had at least begun my daily routine. However, I still had the rest of the day to get through. I was in “survival mode,” so all I had was my routine.I had not had an episode like that in months. Next, I called my mom, which was also a part of my daily routine. She had always been my go-to for advice and counseling. When I deal with anxiety and my symptoms of schizophrenia, I wonder what I would do if I did not have my parents who are my trust partners in my mental health journey.My mom gave me what I call “sensory therapy.” She asked me to use my senses to tell her what was going on around me.My mom asked, “What do you see?”“My neighbor in his convertible driving in the parking lot.” I answered.  “I see a breeze blowing the palm trees. I love that I live in a place where there are palm trees.”She asked me to close my eyes and tell her what I could hear — a dog barking, traffic out on the highway, seagulls squawking. By doing this, I felt in touch with what is real and what is happening around me. Her voice made me feel safe, and I knew I was not back in the desert.I told mom I was looking forward to my exercise for the day, because it would start to get rid of this heavy and full body anxiety. She told me to call her after my exercise, just to check in.Exercise is a regular part of my daily routine. I do it six times a week. Without exercise, racing thoughts and anxiety would fester and envelop my mind. Exercise not only burns off my calories, but also burns away excessive thinking and worrying.Ultimately, I learned that watching an intense movie has become a trigger for me, even though I consider myself to be in recovery. I learned that my routine is crucial to distract myself from thinking I have no control. In the end, I had my action plan: my trust partner, my routine and my self-care. All of these have become imperative for a successful mental health journey— and I hope it can do the same for others.Jason Jepson grew up in Virginia, but he now lives in Myrtle Beach, SC where he advocates for those who have received a diagnosis of severe mental illness.

      "body": "“Why didn't I see this coming?” is a question that many parents may ask themselves. As a mother and a psychologist, I often wondered why I did not identify my son's early symptoms of schizophrenia. The difficulty for me, like most parents, is that early symptoms of schizophrenia often masquerade as other issues, like depression.Unless you have a first degree relative with schizophrenia, and know that this illness is a possible inheritance, schizophrenia is not really a “go-to” diagnosis. And, as important as it is to diagnosis schizophrenia early, identifying the early signs can be very difficult.The best thing a parent or caretaker can do is to make sure that any early symptoms are treated professionally. Then as the psychotic symptoms become apparent, and the diagnosis becomes clear, interventions for schizophrenia are more readily accessible because the person has already engaged in treatment.During most of his childhood my son, Jacob, loved spending time with friends and always made new ones when we vacationed — and he was never at a loss for energy. However, during his sophomore year in high school, these behaviors slowly began to change. He started struggling to find a good fit with friends and became somewhat argumentative with his fellow percussionist in marching band. I labeled this change as “teen angst.” I thought that with some guidance and experience, he would outgrow this phase.Jacob’s “teen angst” continued to grow, and he began to require psychological and medical help for depression. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM), one of the early signs of schizophrenia in about 50% of the cases is depression. This was true in our family’s situation; Jacob was diagnosed and treated for depression several years before he exhibited any obvious symptoms of schizophrenia.His depression spanned the last two to three years of high school. He met regularly with a psychologist and eventually took anti-depressants prescribed by a psychiatrist. He was able to manage his academics and enjoy after-school and church-related activities, but he was not his usual social self. Even with medication, he would sleep excessively. During one mission trip, he spent a whole day sleeping in the back of the van while everyone else was building a deck for a needy family. During a marching band trip to California, he slept through a tour of Hollywood until I was able to wake him up and urge him to join his friends. On the same trip, he fell asleep on the bus to Six Flags and woke up at the bus terminal.Excessive sleeping and social withdrawal were key symptoms of his “depression,” but as I realized later, they can also be possible symptoms of schizophrenia. I didn’t think of it because many adolescents experience depression. According to a 2020 survey by SAMSHA, 4.3 million adolescents between 12 and 17 or 17% of US teens were diagnosed with a major depressive episode. Since schizophrenia impacts between 1 to 2% of the population in general, not all people with depression later develop schizophrenia. So how do you know if your son, daughter or loved one who is depressed will later have schizophrenia? That prediction is very difficult, if not impossible, most of the time.Jacob, however, did show some of other early warning signs, such as thought disorder — a disorganized way of thinking that manifests in abnormal ways of expressing oneself when speaking and writing. During the first semester of his senior year in high school, and about three months before his official diagnosis of schizophrenia, Jacob’s creative writing teacher asked to meet with me. She was concerned about his writing because he kept qualifying his statements with asides in parenthesis. She said that she had talked to him about his use of parentheses, but he continued to use them anyway. She couldn't figure out why he was so resistant to her instructions.When I looked at what he had been doing, I quickly rationalized his style to be related to one of his favorite television programs at the time, Mystery Science Theater. It was a popular program that showed movies with a group of characters taking the part of critics and making funny asides or additions to the scripts. That was certainly an easy conclusion for me to make until I discovered a green spiral notebook in his room titled “My Schizophrenic Notebook.” He, again, used parentheses, but this time it was apparent that his thinking was very disorganized. Unlike some people with his diagnosis, his verbal expression was never noticeably disturbed — but his writing showed obvious evidence of thought disorder.Jacob displayed other “odd” behaviors in his early teens, but they were usually short-lived. Several times, he exhibited brief catalepsy or wooden posturing (one of many manifestations of catatonia). Each time, the behavior seemed to correspond with excessive stress. The third and last time lasted about one hour following the small wedding ceremony for me and his stepfather. Pictures show him sitting on a couch outside the sanctuary in a wooden pose and a distant expression on his face. One of his grandmothers commented that her husband (Jacob’s grandfather) had similar experiences after he returned home from battle following World War II.While Jacob had a good relationship with his new stepfather, he may have been traumatized by the major change in our family structure. Still, it was an unusual reaction. His grandmother's comment was a logical but unexpected explanation. Since I had known his grandfather for many years and had never seen any signs of psychosis, I tucked the experience away in the back of my mind hoping it would not occur again, which it never did. Catatonia is, however, a common symptom among those hospitalized with schizophrenia.As strange as some of these events were, they did not prepare us for what was to come. Most of the time, even with depression and the few odd behaviors, Jacob looked and acted like most other teenagers. He attended school, worked part-time at a local grocery store, enjoyed playing his drums and participated in school and family events. Any other symptoms of schizophrenia, such as auditory hallucinations, that he may have had before his diagnosis were easily masked by his composure.Looking back, the only way to tie these unusual events together as prodromal (or early symptoms of schizophrenia) would have been to know that he had a genetic predisposition. That knowledge did not come to light until later.Jacob had a psychologist to help him with what seemed to be developmental issues related to being a teenager. Later he needed help for what looked like depression so we added a psychiatrist for medication. Because of these interventions, his psychotic symptoms were addressed as soon as they were recognized. Hopefully, in the future, more definitive methods of early identification will be available.Linda Snow-Griffin, Ph.D. is a retired psychologist from Cincinnati, a mental health advocate and an author.

One of them is my mentor, a psychologist with a specialty in clinical psychology, and the other is a voluntary participant in a clinical research study. We’re in an office space on the 22nd floor of a hospital building.My chair is leaning against the wall, and my black tea is sitting conveniently to my right on a small rectangular table. To my left is a small, bare window that offers a view of the blue sky and distant tall buildings. The room is bland, unattractive and poorly lit. As I continue listening to the conversation happening around me, I suddenly begin to feel discomfort.The feeling of discomfort grows exponentially in a matter of seconds; my pulse quickens, my heart races, my body shakes and my temperature rises. I know I have to do something. My breathing becomes shallow, I start sweating profusely and I begin to feel faint. Now I know I really must do something. I’m worried that I might be gasping for air very soon. To cope, I start looking around for exits, mentally tracing the various ways that will get me out of the building fast.I note that the stairway is the best option as I certainly can’t use the elevators and risk being stuck in one. Then, I remember the window. At that moment, I feel instant relief set in, knowing that if I need air, I can just open the window. My heart stops racing, and my breathing normalizes. In the clarity of my relief, I can now identify the episode as a panic attack.A panic attack does not last very long; episodes may only last a few minutes, but due to the intensity of the experience, after the body goes back to “normal,” people often feel depleted of all their energy. In some cases, people’s legs feel wobbly and can’t sustain the weight of their bodies. Sometimes, people notice that their bodies continue to shake, and their thinking becomes clouded and confused.Personally, I’ve found that the aftermath of a panic attack sometimes lasts longer than the episode itself. Accordingly, I will go to great lengths to avoid anything that could trigger another episode.After a panic attack happens, the brain forms an association between its occurrence and the context of the episode (whereabouts, companions, current activities etc.). This process leads to an automatic avoidance response to the site or context in which the panic attack occurred, whether it’s a particular street, a certain comment or a specific activity.Once formed, the mental association reinforces the avoidance behavior, which means that a reminder of where or how panic attack occurred — or even thinking about it, in more extreme cases — could cause another panic attack. Moreover, the very act of avoiding the context in which the panic attack occurred further solidifies the mental association, creating a vicious loop.While panic attacks result in similar symptoms for most people, the actual experience of a panic attack is different for everyone and really determines how we react going forward — and how we can cope.Living with anxiety and panic disorders is difficult; sometimes, it can feel like symptoms are affecting every area of life. At the height of my anxiety attacks, I had to make quite a few lifestyle changes to avoid triggers and overwhelming myself, including spending less time out with my friends, putting aside my studies and taking on fewer responsibilities at work. I also made a few positive changes, like practicing meditation on a regular basis, eating healthy meals and exercising. These changes and new routines were the driving force behind my recovery.Ultimately, I’ve found that the key to overcoming my anxiety is systematic lifestyle changes and perseverance. Once I implemented these changes, I stuck to them and followed them diligently. I found resources online, as well as tips and guidance from practitioners and peers alike. Today, I can say I am free of panic attacks, and my anxiety no longer controls my life. \n\n\nYasmina Rebani-Lee co-founded Mindriselife.org to help other people with anxiety find resources and support to help them overcome their anxiety.

      "body": "For many Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders (AAPI), the experience of being a racial minority in the U.S. is largely informed by the “model minority” stereotype, a cultural expectation that their demographic will achieve a higher degree of socioeconomic success. Specifically, this stereotype suggests that Asian Americans best embody the “American Dream” with an incredibly strong work ethic and inherent intelligence.Accordingly, Asian American students find themselves pressured to attend prestigious universities and pursue esteemed careers (often in law, medicine or engineering). Indeed, AAPI are often perceived as the model of prestige and socioeconomic success.This stereotype is harmful for several reasons as it:Specifically, these cultural expectations have ramifications for the mental health of AAPI and their ability to seek appropriate care. The consequences are dire; according to The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), suicide is the second leading cause of death among Asian American young adults.As I have reflected on my own experience, and learned more about mental health, I have come to believe that addressing the mental health crisis requires understanding the specific ways in which the model minority stereotype prevents AAPI from seeking help for their mental health.The widely perpetuated model minority stereotype often plays out in family dynamics, and in turn, impacts how people address their mental health. For example, respect for the immigrant experience is central to many AAPI households — many of us are made aware of the family sacrifices and hardships that led to a better and successful life in the U.S. Often, this reverence for resilience and strength discourages the sharing of emotions; talking about mental health, in some families, is considered weak and a modern “luxury.”While the conversation surrounding mental health is slowly changing in the U.S., and efforts to destigmatize mental illness are encouraging a cultural shift — I have noticed in the AAPI community that struggles with mental health are scoffed at and brushed off as entitlement.Additionally, I have found that AAPI are often raised to conceal their emotions as a defense against the discrimination and racism they will face. Ultimately, this causes a fear of vulnerability and any perceived failure. As a result, many AAPI are uncomfortable with disclosing their mental health struggles, fearing they will disappoint family members and deviate from the model minority standard.Even when services are made available, how does one advocate for oneself when their upbringing has enforced the need to prioritize their family’s happiness over their own? While resources are available, the information provided doesn’t always provide specific steps to disclosing a mental health issue or explain the basics (for example, the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist or a standard price for treatment).These are possible reasons why AAPI are hesitant to seek support; often, the steps toward self-care are overwhelming and unfamiliar. Many wonder if they even have the time to seek help.Addressing mental health conditions and getting on the path toward recovery is a gradual process that requires patience, especially for those of us who are also unlearning cultural norms. Taking the first steps toward healing is one of many difficulties AAPI face because our culture has taught us that prioritizing one’s personal needs is selfish. Moreover, few people are willing to risk the social and even professional repercussions of deviating from the model minority stereotype to seek help.However, for those who are ready to take this step, there are resources available.Many individuals may prefer to see an AAPI therapist to begin their journey toward healing. If the resources above are still overwhelming, reading AAPI written blogs, finding social media posts and watching YouTube videos about mental health within the AAPI community are other alternatives. Hearing AAPI experiences is another way to begin validating your own experiences. Self-care isn’t selfish or a sign of weakness; rather, it primes us for empowerment and resilience.Phoebe Castillo Chua is a UC Davis alumna working under the Stanford School of Medicine’s LEAP program to improve the health of Bay Area communities.

      "body": "Early warning signs often emerge at the onset or worsening of mental illness symptoms. Simply, put these warning signs are any thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that significantly impair day-to-day functioning — such as feeling excessively sad or low — and they may indicate you need help.Understandably, if you are experiencing unusual thoughts and feelings, you may prefer to ignore them or expect them to pass, but ultimately, it is in your best interest to address them as soon as possible. Otherwise, these feelings and behaviors could lead to worsening symptoms, an episode, relapse or even self-harm.Here are a few considerations to help you address your own warning signs.To keep your mental health in check, you need to determine your baseline — how you are feeling and behaving on a good day, a normal day and a bad day. Early warning signs are typically deviations from your baseline, often starting with small changes, like minor sleep interruptions.You’ll also want to recall any past experiences of mental health struggles or episodes. Were there any changes in your thoughts and behaviors prior to the episode? What did they signal? How did you address them? What were the outcomes? Knowing your past patterns can provide valuable insight into your current situation.Experiencing early warning signs is not necessarily a cause for serious concern, but these signs may warrant monitoring or evaluation by a mental health provider.If you experience what may be an early warning sign and have not been diagnosed with a mental health condition, consider your risk factors for mental illness. These include recent stressful life events (such as a job loss and relationship troubles), genetics and even age (75% of mental illnesses develop by the age of 24).To identify your warning signs, pay close attention to your thoughts, moods, physical symptoms and behavior. They may occur independently or in combination. Warning signs could manifest as changes in emotions — including feelings of low self-esteem, uncertainty, worry, hopelessness, fear, irritability or anger. These can lead to withdrawal and isolation.Warning signs could also manifest in physical changes, like a reduced need for sleep, increased activity and restlessness, sweating, rapid breathing, fatigue or back pain. When evaluating your situation, it’s important to note that these symptoms vary by condition. For example, a reduced need for sleep is often a warning sign for bipolar disorder and fatigue is a common warning sign for depression.Once you determine what warning sign you are experiencing, it is important to note whether the symptom was triggered by something, such as a breakup, or appeared without a clear explanation. If it was triggered by a particular event, you may be able to address the situation through problem-solving or emotion-solving coping strategies.Pay close attention to the impact of each early warning sign on your ability to function and perform daily tasks, grading each one from one to 10 in severity. Quickly progressing and sudden onset of symptoms may indicate that the situation is more concerning. Keep a daily record and be ready to share observations with a supporter or health care provider.Having a plan to address your symptoms and specific needs will allow you to move forward more effectively when warning signs emerge. Importantly, your plan should include alternate ways to perform daily activities that may be impacted; for example, you may need to secure work accommodations. You’ll want the plan to include:There are various coping strategies to address symptoms and your reactions to them. It may help to ask friends, family members and health care providers for their recommendations (but note that each person will have different strategies and not every strategy will work for you). Also remember that you may have to apply coping strategies for the short-term or long-term. These strategies could include:Ultimately, early warning signs should not be ignored, downplayed or dismissed. They may not go away on their own. They are reminders that we all need to monitor our mental health, no matter how well we think we’re doing. And if they do arise, we can successfully address them if we treat them as the prevention tools that they are.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "As I have learned on my mental health journey, managing and coping with the symptoms of bipolar disorder can be challenging. When I was first diagnosed in my mid-twenties, I struggled to fully accept this new reality; frankly, I barely listened to my doctor explain my diagnosis and treatment plan. I followed the recommended treatment plan for a while, but once I started to feel better, I stopped taking my medication and the symptoms returned.My recovery did not begin until I truly accepted that managing my illness would be a lifelong endeavor — an endeavor that requires paying close attention to my warning signs. Once I came to this realization, my life slowly began to change for the better. Now, I fully understand my symptoms, and I have become in tune to my body; as a result, I can identify the causes and warning signs of a possible episode almost immediately. When I determine that it is going to be a difficult day, I am able to prepare myself and use my coping skills to manage my symptoms.Some possible causes and warning signs of my episodes, which I will share in hopes of helping others recognize their own, include:Almost everyone will deal with some form of stress in their lives, but I’ve learned that stress can impact me differently than those who do not live with my mental health condition. If my body is under a lot of stress — personal, professional or a combination of both — for a long period, I am at a higher risk of mood swings, which can evolve into a manic episode.When I experience prolonged stress, my thoughts will begin to race, and my brain struggles to turn off and rest. When I reach this point, my thoughts are scattered and sometimes even doing the simplest tasks is overwhelming. Naturally, this takes a physical and emotional toll.When I notice that I’m not sleeping well, I start to pay close attention to my mental state. Often, if I’m not sleeping, I find that this is due to racing thoughts consistent with a manic episode. What begins as less frequent sleep can easily turn into staying awake for 24 hours — a clear sign of a manic episode.Of course, this lack of sleep will make my physically tired, but often the most difficult symptom is my mind is unable to rest. I may find myself lying in bed, tossing and turning. Usually, my best coping mechanism is staring at the ceiling and praying I will fall asleep. To avoid these scenarios, I do my best to maintain proper sleep hygiene to keep my physical and mental health in check. For me, this means getting at least eight hours of sleep a night.Over time, I’ve learned that unexpected changes to my routine and care regimen, including medications, can trigger an episode. Recently, I took an over-the-counter allergy pill, and within the next few days, I noticed my moods were changing. I spiraled into a depressive episode in which I cried uncontrollably and had no energy at all. A few days later, I found myself feeling irritable, wanting to spend lots of money and talking a mile a minute.After a few weeks of this pattern, I was able to identify this behavior as a bipolar episode that I would need to “ride out.” As I weathered the onslaught of symptoms, I began to reflect on what I had done differently recently, and I remembered that the only change to my regimen was the allergy pill. So, I stopped taking the pill and replaced it with a different one. Within a few weeks, I was back to my usual self.Over the years, I have learned that I have a “type A personality,” and I thrive when I stick to a rigid schedule. I need this to keep myself in order. I do not like chaos; my house is always clean, and I make appointments well in advance. If my schedule gets rearranged unexpectedly or I fall behind, I may begin to panic and spiral.Unfortunately, this character trait is also accompanied by high expectations of myself and others; I expect people to work at the same level of intensity as I do, which can cause me to have added stress in my professional and personal life, which could potentially trigger an episode. However, to manage my mental health, I do my best to organize the things I can control and try to remain flexible whenever possible.Ultimately, I feel blessed to understand my illness and my body well enough to identify the warning signs of a possible episode. By knowing myself and my mental health condition, I am better equipped to manage and cope with bipolar disorder. This is what helps me to find hope through that storm.Tammy Ozolins is a full time educator, residing in Richmond, Va.

      "body": "Since adolescence, I have prided myself on my resilience, my willingness to serve others and my ability to achieve and persevere through any season of life. Growing up, I was captain of a competitive science team and a member of multiple other academic teams. While I was thriving academically, I struggled with my mental health; I dealt with panic attacks caused by a phobia of food and restaurants.I survived months of semi-starving myself because my body would panic when I tried to eat, and I faced the residual effects for years. But I pushed through these challenges and continued to meet the typical definition of “success.” If I could do this, I reasoned, everything was fine.As I reflect on my mental health journey, I now realize that “functional” and “successful” don’t always mean “healthy.”In October of 2021, just a few months after I graduated college, I jetted off to Spain to pursue a master’s degree and teach English abroad. The first month was wonderful; I settled into my new school and began making friends in my program. But slowly my mental health began to spiral. Before I knew it, I was isolating, losing interest in all hobbies and spending the entire weekend alone in my apartment. I couldn’t even get off of the couch.There was a reason I didn’t see this behavior as a sign of something more serious: Even though I was struggling, I made it to work and class every Monday through Friday, and I spent many days gone from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. teaching. Because I was capable of getting up and going to work all of those days — and because I enjoyed much of the time I spent with my students — I concluded nothing was wrong. Truly depressed people can’t get up out of bed and find moments of happiness, right?I soon learned that depression doesn’t always look the way you might expect.It wasn’t until early December, when I self-harmed for the very first time, that I realized I was truly and deeply suffering.I spent the next couple of weeks constantly tugging at my sleeves, making sure that my students never saw my wounds. How do you explain to a child that you hurt yourself on purpose? Ultimately, my concern for my students suppressed my desires to self-harm.The following week, I told myself that I was going to find a therapist, increase my anti-depressant dosage do everything in my power to improve my mental health. I had made a commitment to my students and to my school, and I still had six months of my contract left. But as I made these plans, and rededicated myself to my work, my isolation on the weekends became increasingly worse — and any remnants of motivation disappeared altogether.I was stuck in this nightmarish limbo. Part of me believed that I was capable of staying in Spain for the next six months. I was high functioning, so I knew I’d have no issues making it to school.\nThe other part of me questioned that capability. Yes, you will make it to school, I thought, but is the suffering during the weekend worth it? Will you actually go out and get the help you need?I was distraught by having to make a choice. I loved my school, but I also loved myself. I didn’t want to hurt myself, but I couldn’t control the intrusive thoughts. After weeks and weeks of tears and phone calls with family, friends and my partner, I finally came to a decision. I was coming home.While I was relieved to have arrived at a decision, I still felt like a failure. Why couldn’t the high achieving woman I thought I was get through this? After years of defining myself by my successes, I began to question my worth. Those feelings of inadequacy were crushing, and I am still working through them to this day.The following weeks brought several emotional conversations, the most notable of which was with my school supervisor. During a lunch break one day, in tears, I explained everything that I was going through, and I shared that I had decided to go home. As I spoke, her eyes widened, and she seemed stunned. At the end, she told me: “I had no idea anything was wrong.”From my experience, I have learned that there is no standard image of depression. For those of us with high-functioning depression, we “look ok,” and the people around us don’t know that we’re suffering. We are good at hiding our pain and doing what we’re supposed to — but, as a result, we fly under the radar and can feel even more alone. With some reflection, I have concluded that the best way for me to deal with high-functioning depression is to be open about my mental health and my needs — as difficult as that can be.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "When I was in seventh grade, I started to feel different. My moods changed a lot; I would be fine one minute, then I would be crying and agitated the next. I’m sure the adults in my life thought I was just adjusting to middle school — that the moodiness was a result of turning 13.I remember being overwhelmingly sad, lonely and misunderstood. My sadness was accompanied by intrusive thoughts. Suddenly, horrible notions would parade through my head:Your parents are going to die.\nYou’re going to die.\nSomething bad is going to happen.\nNobody loves you.I didn’t realize that my sadness and intrusive thoughts weren’t normal. The only thing I could do about it, I thought, was pray. Over and over, I’d ask that my thoughts and fears not come true. It became obsessive.As I continued to struggle, I began isolating myself from friends. I also missed a lot of school. When I actually went, I’d ask to go to the nurse so I could call my mom and eventually come home. This happened so frequently that the nurse told my mom I could have school phobia (frequently called school refusal), a term used to describe a child’s severe anxiety about — and resulting avoidance of — attending school. Nothing happened after that call.I continued to miss class and after school activities, even the volleyball games which I’d once loved. I felt enormous guilt about my constant absences, but the relief of staying home was more powerful than the feeling of being around my friends and having fun.Looking back, I can identify those behaviors and feelings as symptoms of depression and an anxiety disorder, but other than one phone call from the school nurse, no one in my life suggested that I needed help. I wish I had spoken up, but I had no idea that what I was experiencing was indicative of a larger problem. As I reflect on my past, I realize just how much early intervention would’ve changed the trajectory of my life.I wasn’t diagnosed with depression or anxiety until I was in college, after my beloved grandmother passed away. I was drowning in grief and went to a college counselor who suggested I find a psychiatrist. As I learned more about depression and anxiety, I realized that I had been battling symptoms since childhood. My Mema’s passing, I realized, was just the final straw. My mental illness had always been there.At first, I didn’t tell anyone that I was seeing a psychiatrist or that I had been prescribed medication. I was embarrassed; I saw how my family members were coping with their grief, and nobody seemed to be struggling the way I was. I dropped two classes, becoming a part-time student. I drove to my parents’ house during the week and on weekends because I needed comfort. I isolated from my roommates and friends, who voiced their concerns, but I couldn’t listen.Eventually, my depression became easier to live with, and I saw it as an inconvenience, rather than an interruption to my everyday life — until years later when I moved away, got married and had children. I experienced severe postpartum depression, and it was more powerful than anything I’d felt before. I had suicidal thoughts, cried all the time and I even started to believe some of my enduring intrusive thoughts. I didn’t feel rational. And I wasn’t. The suicidal thoughts paired with the idea that I wasn’t a good mom. Guilt infiltrated every inch of my body.One night, after a fight with my husband, I was experiencing suicidal thoughts and feeling scared for my future. I called my best friend, frantic, begging for help. She urged me to go to the nearest emergency room, so I did.This incident opened my eyes to just how bad my mental health had become. I couldn’t take care of myself. I went weeks without brushing my teeth. Showering was rare, too. It didn’t feel like I was being a good mom, but how could I? I was pouring from an empty cup. Self-care was at the bottom of my to-do list.Eventually I was admitted to a psychiatric hospital in Houston, Texas, almost four hours away from my family. While I was there, something just clicked. I started to understand my unhealthy coping skills and self-sabotaging behavior. After years of living in denial, I acknowledged my eating disorder, too. I learned about self-care and how to cope when things go wrong.It was like a second chance at life.Now, four years later, I can honestly say I’m in recovery. I’m living my best life and enjoying things I’d taken for granted for years. I still have bad days. I still have horrible days, but now I know how to deal with it. I go to therapy weekly and work with the local chapter of NAMI, NAMI Greater Corpus Christi.Do I wish things had gone differently? Sometimes. I feel like the best version of myself, but it still hurts thinking of that lonely seventh grader begging God not to die. The signs of mental illness were all there, but she stigma of mental illness prevented anyone from noticing or speaking up.Now we know better. I work to end stigma and share my experience so this won’t happen to another little girl. I’ll keep fighting for that seventh grade me until my last breath.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "For most of my life, I have battled depression and mania. There were weeks on end when I could not get out of bed. I would scold myself for not being whatever it was I needed to be that day: a better mother or a better wife. I would also spend weeks or months as an upbeat, fearless, spunky, funny and driven woman — a woman who could command the attention of the room with confidence. There was rarely a middle ground.When these symptoms began, I did not have a specific diagnosis, but I did know something was wrong; a fact, I thought, I was never going to admit to anyone. I had a nice group of friends, and I was afraid of losing them with the news of my mental illness.Despite my insistence on keeping my condition private, I knew just how serious the consequences of mental illness could be. In 2005, my father-in-law was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, stopped taking his medication and ultimately, died by suicide. But I knew I could never take my own life; it would be cruel to allow my husband to lose both a father and a wife to the same fate. I loved him too much to do that to him.In fact, I was angry at my father-in-law when he died. I did not understand why he would choose to leave his family — or why he would create such chaos in his family’s lives. Due to my own internalization of misinformation and sigma surrounding mental illness, I could not empathize with his pain or see his struggles as a result of illness and isolation rather than bad choices.As I have grappled with my own mental health challenges, and witnessed the mental health challenges of those close to me, I have often wondered: does “unconditional love” actually have conditions for those with mental illness? And how can we change this?After I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and my symptoms escalated, I began to understand my father-in-law’s struggle. He had once described himself as a “shell of a person” — something I had not understood at the time. I never imagined I would know first-hand what that felt like, being a \"shell,\" but I did, 16 years later. In the summer 2021, I was faced with the same alienation and fear of this illness, dealing with it nearly alone, and wholly misunderstood.By the end of June, my symptoms reached the point where I lost touch with reality. My memory of these manic and psychotic episodes is patchy; I know that I did things, but it was as if I was not in control of the reins. Other than short flashes of memory, everything is blank. My behavior, I learned later, included filing an undeserved Protection from Abuse on my husband. Naturally, this caused traumatic upheaval in my family life.My children were deeply upset by my actions, but I did not see any concerning changes in behavior. Even when I saw creatures crawling out of the walls and “zapping” me, I called no one. I would see my children in the house, even though they had chosen to stay with their father.  I'd feel them hugging me and turn to hug them back. Each time, I was reduced to tears because they were not actually there.During this time, I was full of paranoia, fear and anger, and I was filled to the brim with confusion, trying to make sense of reality in complete isolation. The police eventually found me sobbing on my front lawn, screaming that my kids had been kidnapped (by that point I'd spent weeks without them and had no idea that I was the cause of it). The episode culminated with a two-and-a-half-week stay in a psychiatric hospital and months in group outpatient counseling.After my mental health crisis, I faced several challenges. Of course, I had to grapple with the reality of my manic behaviors, but I also had to weather the loss of people who could not accept that I had an illness.Perhaps the most devastating loss was Melanie, my best friend of 30 years. She was angry with me and doubted my illness. \"You are hiding behind this bipolar lie,\" she wrote to me. Then, after being shut out by Melanie, I lost all my friends overnight. As I tried to make sense of this loss, I began to understand the isolation my father-in-law must have felt and the ridicule he likely endured from those he trusted.Now, with the right treatment and medication, I am more emotionally stable. After reflecting on the last year, I have realized something: who I am as a person is not changed by my mental illness. I believe that statement is what we need to start shouting from the rooftops in order to dismantle the stigma of mental illness. A diagnosis (or even a mental health crisis) does not strip us from the good parts of who we are. We are the same people we always were: glorious, fun, driven, intelligent, valuable people.These illnesses do not change who we are and embracing that fact will allow a cultural shift. We are valuable. We should not accept being shunned, nor should we beg those who left us to come back.  These illnesses are a chance for us to rebuild ourselves without those who judge and discard us. It is a chance for us to shine in our lives and finally be happy.Anastasia Leiphart has been a freelance writer for nearly 20 years, and her work has appeared in various trade and commercial publications including “Property and Yacht” and “Today's Modern Teacher.” She now runs a blog called “Razing Rachel,” which tells her story of living with bipolar disorder.

      "body": "As those of us who live with the diagnosis know, schizophrenia is a difficult condition to relate to. Most people can sympathize with someone who is suffering from an evident physical injury, such as a broken leg. They can also understand the plight of someone with a less visible illness, like cancer. Perhaps they haven’t experienced those particular medical issues, but they can imagine the physical pain and conceptualize the fear.On the other hand, a serious mental illness like schizophrenia can be more difficult to imagine, as it affects one’s ability to interpret reality, often without any apparent physical symptoms. Much of the general population will never experience this, nor are they able to imagine battling their own minds in this way.Due to our possible misinterpretations of reality, those of us with schizophrenia may say and do things that seem bizarre to others, further alienating us from other people — even people who wish to help or understand us. For this reason, we suffer an onslaught of stigmatizing assumptions, labeling us “crazy” or “insane” — language with negative connotations that is never used to describe someone healing from a physical problem.The cycle of social stigma and misinformation compounds the already-challenging experience of managing a mental health condition.Awareness of the lived experience of schizophrenia is lacking; a relatively small percentage of Americans feel as if they are familiar with schizophrenia, and many who have heard of the condition are fearful of encountering people with schizophrenia at work or in their personal lives — even those who are undergoing treatment.This stigma is exacerbated by negative press coverage. Often, when someone with schizophrenia appears in the media, it is usually in relation to a violent incident — even though, statistically, people with schizophrenia are less likely to commit violent acts than those who do not have the condition. In fact, people with schizophrenia are more likely to be victims of violence than are members of the general population.With media representations painting a different picture, how is someone who wishes to understand able to set aside the condition’s negative social connotations and lend support? If people continue to see those living with this condition as inherently “crazy” rather than ill, how will we move forward?In addition to combatting the misinformation and misleading representations of schizophrenia, people with the condition often struggle to self-advocate, as they often feel different from the average person. For many of us with schizophrenia, communicating with and persuading a large audience (in hopes of educating about schizophrenia and our lived experience) is difficult and even frightening.Those managing noticeable symptoms fear being seen as “strange,” and we become acutely aware of the ways in which they lack an ability to relate to other people. It often feels as though the mental and emotional functions that allow humans to connect have been set askew in some way.The result of widespread stigma is not simply an unfortunate social experience for those with schizophrenia — it is a life-threatening challenge. The life expectancy of someone with schizophrenia is roughly two decades shorter than that of the general population, arguably due to the prevalence of suicide among people with the condition (specifically among those who do not seek help, fearing stigma and discrimination). Oftentimes, those who die by suicide are considered “high-functioning,” as they are aware that they are sick and can comprehend the extent of their social isolation and perceived dysfunction.But this does not have to be the reality. If we can commit to educating ourselves on the condition, promoting accurate and nuanced representations of schizophrenia and prioritizing advocacy, we may see more favorable times to come.Casey Clabough, who lives with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, is an author and editor.

      "body": "“Two-Pound Baby Wins Life Fight,” was the front-page headline of the Feb. 21, 1962 edition of the Jefferson City, Missouri Post-Tribune. That baby was me, and the story celebrated my release from the hospital after spending months in an incubator struggling to survive.\n\nAt 15 months old, doctors told my parents that I had an intellectual disability. My mother questioned this diagnosis, and she fought to find another answer. Several months later, I was diagnosed with cerebral palsy. I experienced a childhood filled with leg braces, painful surgeries and bullying.\n\nAs I got older, my various physical disabilities progressed. I found myself looking for ways to advocate for people with disabilities. Beginning in 2001, I dedicated my time to breaking down barriers surrounding physical disabilities and promoting full accessibility on various disability commissions and committees in Maryland.\n\nMy journey to tackle ableism, however, would not end there. After being diagnosed with a mental health condition, I began to unpack the realities of the stigma surrounding mental illness — and discovering how much progress needs to be made.In 2014, I was hospitalized and first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As I struggled to accept the diagnosis, I refused to follow up with psychiatric treatment or take my medication as directed, which led to a much more serious bipolar episode in 2019 that almost cost me my life. After surviving a suicide attempt, I listened to my doctors, took my medication and, more importantly, accepted my diagnosis. Today, I take my medication as directed and continue to see my psychiatrist on a regular basis.\n\nWhen I was first hospitalized in 2014, however, I was too ashamed to tell anyone that I had a mental health issue. I was afraid to talk about it because I, like so many others, held deeply internalized negative attitudes about mental illness and seeking help. This stigma was something that all of my fellow patients wrestled with during their hospitalizations: They simply didn’t know how to tell other people about their mental illness.\n\nDuring group therapy we were told we shouldn’t be afraid or ashamed to share our diagnosis with others. But that wisdom was hard to accept. Frankly, my initial reaction was, “It’s one thing to tell people that I was hospitalized due to my cerebral palsy. It’s a whole other thing to say I am bipolar, and I just got out of the hospital’s Behavioral Health Unit (what many people incorrectly label the psych ward).”\n\nBefore being hospitalized for mental health treatment, I had only heard people with mental health issues described as “crazy,” so I was afraid to open up about my own diagnosis.Since my time in treatment, I have noticed that we seem to have no trouble talking endlessly about our physical health when we get together with family and friends: “I just went to see a new orthopedist.”  “I just completed a new round of physical therapy.” etc. Our health comes up naturally in both serious conversations and small talk. But we don’t open up about our mental health in a similar, casual way.\n\nYou rarely hear someone mentioning that they were just diagnosed with borderline personality disorder or that they’re running late to a therapy appointment. This needs to change; if we continue to hide the reality of our mental health, we perpetuate a cycle of stigma and shame. If you don’t speak up, someone else will continue to suffer in silence.\n\nTo do my part in dismantling a culture of stigma and silence, I will confidently tell others that I have bipolar disorder or mention that I have an appointment with my psychiatrist. By normalizing my experience, I hope to play a part in removing the stigma and fear surrounding mental health. My story is evidence of how someone can live and thrive with both a physical disability and a mental health issue. Now, I’m comfortable saying, “I have cerebral palsy, I have bipolar disorder, and I’m not alone. Many of us have physical disabilities and mental health issues.”\n\nI not only pay attention when people use the wrong words to describe people with physical disabilities (“crippled,” for example), but I also notice when people use negative words like “crazy” to describe those of us with mental health issues. I don’t hesitate to let people know that, “I have a disability. I’m not crippled.” And I say, “I am not crazy. I have a mental health condition.”\n\nI was fortunate to get the help I needed, and I hope anyone else struggling will do the same. If I can encourage one person to get help in an emergency by reaching out to a family member, friend, general practitioner, psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist, my story will have made a difference.\n\nIf you or someone you know is experiencing emotional distress or thoughts of suicide, help is available.

      "body": "In a segment of his show “Real Time with Bill Maher,” famed comedian, television host and political commentator Bill Maher joked that then-president Donald Trump received his news from “a passing mental patient.” The implication was, given Maher’s criticisms of Trump’s competence, that such patients lack any awareness of their surroundings or the intelligence to determine fact from fiction. Of course, Maher’s joke got the laughs he was looking for. But the fact that a public figure can entertain an audience by resorting to negative stereotypes of people with mental illness is proof that stigma is alive and well in society — and it does not need to lurk in the shadows.Popular comedy sets, TV shows and social media discourse alike are rife with jokes about “looney bins,” “straitjackets” and “crazy people” hearing voices. Moreover, these harmful depictions often go unchallenged, allowing stigma to proliferate.It seems that this pervasive stigma lies in the time-worn misconception that mental health conditions are a personal and moral failing — rather than illnesses requiring treatment, much like any other health issue. As a result, far too many people see those with mental health conditions as “damaged” people who are responsible for their own afflictions and simply unable to make better choices.This misguided judgment, in turn, leads to the isolation and marginalization of people with mental illness. Some internalize this stigma, and their shame prevents them from seeking help. Others may seek help but feel obligated to hide their experience for fear of social and professional repercussions. Both of these outcomes are unacceptable and perpetuate a cycle of judgment, shame and pain.Unfortunately, a secondary perpetrator of stigmatization can be the medical profession itself. For far too long, practitioners have approached physical health and mental health separately. Physical health, it seems, is treated as “real medicine,” while mental health is regarded as a separate, and often lesser, discipline. This separation also impacts the language we use. When someone receives inpatient treatment for a physical illness, we simply say that someone was “hospitalized.” When referring to inpatient treatment for mental health conditions, we often use much more offensive language about the nature of treatment, such as “went to the madhouse.”To begin changing the cultural taboo, we need to talk more about the reality of mental health. Understanding the basic science is a good place to start: The brain is an organ, and, like other organs, illness surfaces when it malfunctions. Disruptions in mood, appetite and sleep, for example, are indicators of a chemical imbalance in the brain. A more accurate representation of mental illness (in media and elsewhere) would understand that mental health is health — and it has physical origins. Deepening this understanding will allow us to move away from the misconception that mental health conditions are a choice.Of course, perfectly representing mental illness — in media and beyond — is challenging. Living with mental illness, much like having a physical ailment, does not translate to one universal experience; accordingly, there is no singular, accurate characterization of a person with a mental illness. However, we must demand a variety of representations rather than settle for the tired, harmful tropes of a “mental patient” with a loose grasp on reality.In actuality, mental illness can affect anyone, anywhere and at any time. It doesn’t matter what a person’s moral fortitude or station in life is. Additionally, mental illness will present differently in different people. It can look like a person detached from reality. It can also look like creative genius (Virginia Woolfe, Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky and Walt Whitman, to name a few).It is time to extinguish the embers of mental health stigma. This process cannot happen overnight, as negative conceptions are deeply woven into our socialization. Stigmatizing language goes unchallenged, promoting a silent acceptance of the status quo. As a result, harmful language and careless jokes litter our social media feeds and flood our screens. But these jokes hurt real people and ignore their humanity. Mental illness has many faces, and it could be your sibling, parent, friend or partner — and their worth must not be measured by what diagnosis they have, but who they are.This piece was written by an anonymous contributor with the help of NAMI Staff.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I was walking through the self-help section of a bookstore. A title caught my eye: “Disarming the Narcissist: Surviving and Thriving with the Self-Absorbed.” For several years, I have had a clinical interest in working with patients with narcissistic personalities, and so I felt discouraged by the tone of this title.I felt worse upon realizing it was one of many books within this theme. Shoppers could have also purchased “Becoming the Narcissist’s Nightmare: How to Devalue and Discard the Narcissist While Supplying Yourself” or even “How to Kill a Narcissist: Debunking the Myth of Narcissism and Recovering from Narcissistic Abuse.”I wondered: How have we reached the point where former loved ones are meant to be discarded, devalued and disarmed? If you are reading this blog, you may know someone with narcissistic traits or even identify with some of these qualities — and you may benefit from a more nuanced discussion.Clinically, narcissistic personality disorder is viewed as a disorder of self that results in character traits of self-emphasis, grandiose ideations and behaviors that impair relationships — ranging from demands for adoration to entitlement and exploitative behaviors.There can be no doubt: Forging a co-existence with someone with these qualities is complex, and I would never encourage someone to persist in a relationship with a partner who is unwilling to self-reflect, self-challenge and seek the help they need.But what underlies this condition?Psychologists and therapists who work with this population know people with narcissistic traits hold esteem split at both high and low extremes, not just high esteem as is the common trope. Plainly, people with a narcissistic condition suffer from low self-esteem for which they often compensate with a vulnerable and easily shattered grandiosity. If you have ever seen someone ricochet from self-admiration to self-deprecation in an instant, you may have a clear mental image of this internal process.In other words, a narcissistic personality is a form of defense against emotional pain and inner turbulence.When we simply examine symptoms of narcissism on their own, we lose sight of systems that create such personalities and how, at the root, there is often trauma. Complex trauma, violent or sexual traumatic experiences, and the accumulation of stress secondary to identity-based trauma can contribute to elevated narcissism. In clinical settings, the individual with narcissism often presents with a history of caregiver neglect, attachment dysfunction, persistent invalidation and traumatic disruptions to development that increase the likelihood for a personality that neither serves the individual nor others well.I wonder, if one takes a deep breath and reflects, if reframing narcissism as a disorder of trauma lessens the intensity of our reaction to the word?The brain craves simplicity. This is why we think in terms of binaries (e.g., this is good/this is bad; this is safe/this is dangerous). Making a quick decision moves us forward and feels comfortable. Tolerating ambiguity and complexity, such as how all people hold both positive and negative qualities, can be mentally taxing. And so, even with our limited bandwidth, I challenge us to consider the costs of simplifying a complicated issue. Reducing our loved ones into a binary may ease navigation of conflict in the short-term — yet it comes at the expense of long-term relational insight. Through contextualizing traits in others, we remember our common humanity.Healing begins there.When we hold ourselves and others as whole, complex beings, we are empowered to make sense of our experiences and narratives. This perspective helps to make our boundaries stronger, relationships balanced and our former relationships appreciated in their full context.A core complaint of having a relationship with someone with narcissism is the experience of feeling objectified and devalued. As a result, the hurt person may unconsciously devalue the individual with narcissism — or devalue people with narcissism generally. Unchecked and unaware, this devaluation of people with narcissistic personalities carries substantial risk.Devaluation and stigma complicate clinicians’ ability to diagnose the condition (for desire to protect their patients from hardship) and reduces the likelihood that people with these personalities will seek needed care. Would you trust a practitioner to help when they tell someone else to discard you?I understand and respect the intention of resources created to support someone in — or recovering from — an abusive relationship. These relationships are unacceptable and untenable. However, finding appropriate care can be nearly impossible when stigma runs so high or paints your personality as singular in presentation (i.e., portraying all people with narcissism as “toxic”).To heal, we must see ourselves and others as whole. People with narcissistic personalities are among our partners, family and friends, and they deserve quality care and safe access to treatment and self-help supports.Dr. Jackson Newsome is a licensed clinical psychologist and the founder of his private practice: Forge Psychology Chicago.

      "body": "One night in college, my friend (I’ll call Alex) told me about a traumatic moment in their life. At some point during the story, they began gliding over their R’s. New York, I thought, but how had I never noticed they had an accent before? A few minutes later, they referred to themselves in the third person.Before I realized what was happening, Alex blinked and cracked their neck. And everything was normal again; no accent, not even a memory of the conversation. “Switching,” I would eventually learn to call it. This interaction, I later realized, was my first experience with a person who has dissociative identity disorder (DID). In the moment, I’d nearly missed it.Over the course of our friendship, I met more of Alex’s alters, distinct personalities with unique names, genders, ages, interests and worldviews. One spoke languages that Alex did not. Some remembered otherwise lost fragments of childhood. Together, they made up a collective “system” — a group of personalities helping to manage Alex’s trauma. If Alex felt threatened, a more assertive alter might step in. If they felt especially safe, or silly, a childlike one might emerge. In the case of flashbacks, it wasn’t uncommon for an alter to come out just to give Alex a break. Sometimes the switching process was noticeable, but often it was not.I wanted to be sensitive to Alex’s experience, but I was full of questions. Who exactly was my friend? The entire system, or only the person I’d met first (often referred to as the host)? Did the alters count, too? Were they separate, different people? If one of them did something Alex didn’t remember, who was responsible?I wasn’t able to resolve these questions in a satisfying way. So, I did what I’ve always done with questions: I looked for stories to help me understand. Unfortunately, the stories I found were anything but helpful.Perhaps the following story sounds familiar: A mild-mannered protagonist pursues a criminal. Over time, the hunt turns desperate, dangerous. Our protagonist finds himself disoriented and confused. Finally, at a breaking point, he falls to his knees and realizes: Our hero is the very killer he’s been looking for.As I went looking for films about DID, this was basically what I found: Stories of evil alter egos and traumatized murderers, like “Secret Window,” “Primal Fear” and “Mr. Brooks,” to name a few. DID was almost always confined to that single, murderous reveal — a twisty iteration of Jekyll and Hyde. Even the few non-murderous representations — “The Three Faces of Eve” and “Sybil,” for example — were highly sensationalized, with dozens of alters ripping the protagonist’s life apart.None of these films came even close to representing my friend’s experience. Alex was a high-achieving college student who also maintained a side job. I regularly went to them for advice. They just also happened to have DID.I caught wind that a major studio was set to release a big-budget DID story in 2016. Judging by what had come before, I didn’t have much reason to be hopeful, but I was. Maybe this one would be helpful, accurate, faithful. Unfortunately, M. Night Shyamalan’s “Split” is a disastrous representation. Kevin Crumb, played by James McAvoy is, just like the others, confined to the role of murderous antagonist. But the movie doesn’t stop there. In the final act, Crumb switches to his “Beast” alter personality — a superhuman cannibal who wants to rid the world of the non-traumatized.Almost immediately, the mental health community decried the film as inaccurate and harmful, just another portrayal that would implicitly claim traumatized people were a danger to society (despite virtually every statistic showing people with DID are more likely to be victims of crimes than perpetrators). Critics who had lived experience with DID wrote an open letter to M. Night Shyamalan, calling the film a “gross parody based on fear, ignorance and sensationalism, only much worse.” Despite this, “Split” went on to gross almost $280 million worldwide and even spawned a sequel.Watching these films made me wonder: Why are we so afraid of people who have survived trauma? Or, if we aren’t, why do so many of our stories suggest otherwise? Do we really believe that once a person has suffered, the only social recourse is for the rest of us to avoid them?When our only depictions of an already-stigmatized mental illness include sensationalized misinformation, it causes undeniable harm. Moreover, movies like “Split,” I’d argue, are not about DID and trauma at all; rather, they are about pondering what makes someone capable of evil. They fail to highlight that monsters are the abusers who cause trauma, not survivors of trauma who are left to cope. The big question for most survivors of trauma is not “Am I capable of evil?” It’s “How do I live when evil has already been done to me?”DID is a coping mechanism in the face of unrelenting trauma. Indeed, some alters took the brunt of the past abuse, thereby keeping the host capable of going about daily life, unaware of the full extent of their own trauma. Alex’s story is not an outlier. Millions of children experience neglect, trauma and abuse. But when it comes time to write the story, many creatives seem more comfortable portraying DID as demon possession — the stuff of horrifying twist-endings, rather than face the reality of what happens to far too many children.As I continued to grapple with my lingering questions about Alex and explored the complex reality of being close to someone as they confront trauma, I refused to accept the on-screen portrayals of my friend as a monster. So, I decided to tell a new story: My debut novel, “When Fire Splits the Sky,” which will be released in the fall. The story is told from the perspective of a couple, in which one partner has DID, as they confront a catastrophe and assess their crumbling relationship.I hoped this would address some of those lingering questions: How would a person already adapted to trauma respond to a widespread crisis? How would alters handle something like a long-term relationship? What if only some of them wanted the relationship? How would they respond to a betrayal of trust?This portrayal is by no means perfect, but I’ve done my best to honor the experience of my friend — and their alters, who read and provided feedback at multiple stages, giving their blessing to the final project before I sent it out into the world.My hope is to answer the question I have been asking myself since the start of this journey — what would it be like to center a story on DID in an authentic, non-sensationalized way?Tyler James Russell is the author of “To Drown a Man” (2020), a poetry collection, and a forthcoming novel “When Fire Splits the Sky” (November 2022) from Unsolicited Press.

      "body": "As mental health experts and people living with mental illness know all too well, the stigma surrounding mental illness can be highly destructive. Indeed, negative and discriminatory attitudes that are commonly held about people living with mental illness can adversely impact nearly every aspect of their lives.Notably, this cultural taboo discourages many people from seeking help. Leaving symptoms untreated often makes them worse — ultimately powering a vicious cycle of stigma and poor mental health. Thus, the impact of stigma can be as severe as the consequences of the illness itself. I know. I live with serious mental illness (SMI) and the forces of stigma.Addressing stigma is not easy, as these tightly held misconceptions of mental illness are pervasive and systemic. We need much more than time-limited, attention-grabbing sound bite campaigns. We need campaigns of substance. Anti-stigma interventions must seek to do what’s best for people living with mental illness, first and foremost. We need to prioritize approaches that create opportunities for maximum impact and positive outcomes.Here are several methods and best practices to consider when combatting stigma surrounding mental illness.Research suggests that there are three primary methods that are effective in addressing stigma:Based on my own lived experience, here are a few important groups to keep in mind when reducing stigma. Note that stigma interventions should be tailored to the individuals, populations and specific circumstances being targeted.People with Mental Illness\nSelf-stigma is pervasive and a major barrier toward recovery. To best target those dealing with self-stigma, interventions should raise awareness about the possibility of recovery. This involves sharing stories of success and encouraging people to pursue recovery by including seeking, accepting, engaging and adhering to treatment and participating in life activities. It is also important for targeted campaigns to be relatable.Anti-stigma messages targeted to people with mental illness can include:Clinicians\nUltimately, I found that stigma from health care providers can be the most harmful. Indeed, I could have reached recovery sooner if I had more constructive relationship with my mental health professionals. Their stigmatizing language and behavior — like the time my former psychiatrist told me that my condition would only get worse — were impediments to healing. As a result, I developed a “why bother?” attitude, as many patients do. A prognosis should be realistic, but it should also be hopeful, no matter how challenging a situation is. For me, and many other patients, coping with the long-term impacts of practitioners’ missteps was critical in reaching recovery.Anti-stigma messages aimed at clinicians can include:Loved Ones and Friends\nStigma coming from loved ones can be the most hurtful, even if it’s unintentional. When our loved ones appear to be ashamed and embarrassed of us, it can be extremely hurtful. For example, my parents and spouse worried about what people might think of them personally and professionally if they learned of my illness. I lost my best “friend” of over 20 years and many more when I got sick, because they did not want to “associate” themselves with someone with a mental illness.Anti-stigma messages targeted to loved ones can include:All interventions should be inspired and informed by those of us with mental illness. Accordingly, anti-stigma campaigns should be thoughtfully designed, implemented and executed with our direct involvement. They should always be creative and engaging to maximize reach and adoption — and, critically, they should meet people “where they’re at.” This means that messages should be accessible, while remaining well-informed by reliable evidence-based sources of information and involving individuals with subject matter expertise (such as medical, academic, legal and lived experience).It’s also important to note that a wide variety of types of interventions can be effective, if well executed. For example, short-term interventions, like NAMI Walks, can be very effective at bringing large groups of people together and create heightened awareness of issues. Meanwhile, long-term interventions, like lobbying government bodies, can lead to meaningful impacts, such as criminal justice reform and legislative change.These interventions must recognize the realities and possibilities of our lives and, most importantly, they should acknowledge that such possibilities include recovery and full life. A recovery-centric, anti-stigma campaign may be the solution to dismantling stigma while inspiring hope. Ultimately, successful initiatives will always reflect the philosophy of “nothing about us without us.”Helpful resource: Patrick Corrigan, The Stigma Effect: Unintended Consequences of Mental Health Campaigns.A word on NAMI: Since its founding in 1979, NAMI has led many highly successful national and local anti-stigma interventions that have bettered the lives of countless people affected by mental illness.

      "body": "The television screen goes dark, then flashes red. There’s a scream. Broken glass. Laughter. Then, the image returns. A nurse prepares a syringe. A man in a straitjacket talks to himself, responding to apparent voices in his head. The background music crescendos dramatically. The man talks faster and begins twitching. The nurse walks faster. Her white heels click on the shining floor. A team of Hollywood creatives has achieved their goal by inspiring fear in me — and likely, many other viewers — thanks to their use of the antiquated trope of a scary and abusive psychiatric ward.With so many movies to choose from, psychiatric hospital horror is its own genre of film. Perhaps you’ve been terrified by scenes from classic films like “Clockwork Orange” or “Asylum,” 2000s movies like “Shutter Island” or “Insanitarium,”and even newer films like “Unsane,” or “Gonjiam: Haunted Asylum.” These films (some of which have received critical acclaim) have certainly elevated the thriller/horror genre. But they go beyond telling a gripping story; they perpetuate negative stereotypes about treatment centers and the patients who seek care there. Because most people don’t encounter real psychiatric units, these on-screen depictions may be the only representation of psychiatric treatment audiences will ever see.Unsurprisingly, then, our first associations with inpatient psychiatric treatment are danger, unlivable conditions, unpredictability and even abuse. As a result, those needing inpatient treatment are hesitant (and often quite resistant) to entering a facility. Loved ones are often scared to visit. And, ultimately, people who have taken the steps to get help and recover rarely admit to having spent time in an inpatient facility. Spending time in a psych ward is taboo, and the decision to get help is understood as a dirty secret rather than a sometimes-necessary step toward recovery.To dismantle the stigma surrounding hospitalization and psychiatric treatment, it’s important to share the truth about the experience. If we can be transparent about how inpatient treatment works — and what a potential stay might look like — we can start to challenge the terrorizing depictions on our screens.As many movie buffs have asked, “so, what?” Horror movies are made for the purpose of entertainment — just a thrilling escape from reality that people enjoy. Everyone knows that the tortured and possessed patients are made-up characters in a fictionalized world. However, the lived experience of mental illness and seeking treatment is not so simple. While audiences can acknowledge that these cinematic worlds aren’t real, they still fail to separate the negative associations from people with mental illness.Those experiencing mental health crises still hear stigmatizing language and painful labels: “crazy,” “psycho,” “nuts,” “insane” — even “possessed.” Naturally, no one wants to be called these names or have this judgment cast upon them.So, those who need help may avoid it. They don’t go to treatment. They don’t get the help they need, and they get worse. Often, this culminates in patients being forced into hospitalization. Then, after doing the work to find recovery, they will keep their experience a secret. Seeking treatment and finding recovery becomes a skeleton in the closet. But ultimately, a support system is vital to any type of healing.To have a support system, you have to say you need support. Many patients close off further; they shrink their support systems rather than growing and strengthening them — all because of public perception, a perception propagated by the antiquated trope of the “scary” mental health ward.That’s why it matters. Public perception matters. Public perception influences people’s opinions of who they are and what they “should” do. Accurate representations of psychiatric units in movies and television could be a positive influence for people to get the help they need and deserve.Ginger Robertson is a registered nurse and mental health blogger.

      "body": "In 2011, when I was diagnosed with major depressive order and generalized anxiety disorder during my first semester of college, I wasn’t exactly surprised. Mostly, I was relieved to have an explanation. The diagnoses felt like a validation of the sleepless nights, unexplainable chest pains, spiraling thoughts, crushing despair and constant exhaustion. There was a name for — and a reason why — someone with an objectively good life couldn’t manage to get out of bed and face reality every day.But as I scanned the insurance paperwork (which was marked with specific numbers corresponding to diagnoses) and reviewed the slip of paper prescribing medication, I felt a lump in my throat. I wasn’t sure how to share this information with those closest to me. Would they see me differently? Would they say I was unstable? Or “crazy”?Friends and family had expressed concerns about my behavior in the past — the hyperventilating, the constant fear of the future, the days spent in bed — but having an actual name for this behavior felt so official. So clinical. How would I convince my friends, family, potential partners, teachers or future bosses that I was trustworthy? Or capable? Or normal?To manage my anxiety and depression, I began attending therapy sessions regularly and taking daily medication. These changes to my routine were lifesaving; my problems didn’t go away, but they suddenly felt manageable. I even developed specific coping mechanisms to address my panic attacks and depressive spirals. Still, despite the obvious improvement in my day-to-day life, I was embarrassed about the new label I’d been saddled with. My face flushed when my roommates caught me taking pills in the morning, and I found myself scanning the street outside my therapist’s office, terrified of seeing a familiar face.To ease my own discomfort (and what I assumed to be the discomfort of others) I mocked myself mercilessly. By addressing the elephant in the room, I reasoned, I was protecting myself. Maybe a harsh word or an unsolicited opinion about my mental health would hurt less if I said it first. So, I made sure to call my daily medication “my crazy pills.” I consistently referred to myself as “emotionally unstable,” “chemically imbalanced” and, in the opening line of a dating app profile, “a hot mess of DSM terms.”Throwing around careless language, I quickly realized, did not make me feel better. My anxiety escalated as I tried to read people’s facial expressions and over-analyzed their reactions when I mentioned my mental health. The more I tried to eliminate the awkwardness, the more negative attention I drew to myself. And I certainly wasn’t putting anyone else at ease. Friends and strangers alike usually stared at the floor, unsure of how to respond, when I made a joke about my mental illness.Moreover, my toxic approach to addressing my own situation emboldened those who were not as well-intentioned to use similarly offensive terms. I was taken aback when a classmate referred to his partner as “certifiably insane” and winced when another joked about how her mother needed to be “committed to a psych ward” for her constant text messaging. But how could I expect them to speak carefully or respectfully when I consistently referred to myself as “a lunatic”?After several months of making jokes at my own expense (and, of course, unpacking this behavior in therapy), I realized that the stigma and judgment I feared was not coming from those around me — it was coming from me. My offensive quips to cut the tension only perpetuated negative stereotypes about mental illness. They also made otherwise normal conversations awkward and tense. So, I made a concerted effort to change my approach.I began talking openly about therapy with my friends, even sharing valuable insights my therapist had given me when it was appropriate. Eventually, I had offered so much advice that I became a resource to friends who needed strategies for managing stress. “Thank God for your therapist,” one friend joked. “She makes all of our lives better.”I also began referencing therapy in a casual way, much like how my friends talked about their various medical appointments. When comparing schedules to organize a group outing, we planned around Katy’s wrist MRI and my therapy appointment. Over time, my mental illness became a medical issue as mundane as any other.Years later, as the national conversation about mental health has continued to evolve, many of those friends have begun therapy themselves. And talking about our mental health now feels as comfortable as talking about what TV shows we’re watching. It’s one small part of who we are — and it carries no connotations of “craziness” or incompetence, like I once feared.While I am extraordinarily lucky to have a community that understands the reality of mental illness, that doesn’t mean that everyone I encounter has risen above the pervasive stigma. Sometimes, making progress requires having tough conversations.Perhaps the hardest part of combatting stigma is having difficult conversations with the people you see regularly. However, I’ve found that being gentle and honest is an effective way to start. I’m open about my mental health conditions and I’m happy to answer questions that people have. If I hear someone using the careless language I once used, I take the opportunity to share my lived experience.Change doesn’t happen overnight.

      "body": "As a Black woman living with mental illness, I’ve been told plenty of times by other Black people that I should not talk about my experience managing my mental health condition. That sentiment is always frustrating and discouraging to hear.The pervasive stigma surrounding mental illness in the Black community often makes me feel like my life is embarrassing and that I must hide a major part of myself. Sometimes, this shame can be too much to bear. But it also led me to wonder: How widespread is mental illness itself in the Black community? I figured that understanding the statistics would make it easier to erase the stigma.I did some research, and as it turns out, I am certainly not the only Black person experiencing mental illness. Among the nearly 5 million Black people living with a mental illness, nearly a quarter reported having a serious condition, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression, among many others.Despite that sizeable number, only 1 out of every 3 seek suitable treatment, which could include meeting with a mental health professional, such as a social worker, therapist or psychiatrist. While there are many factors contributing to the discrepancy between prevalence and people seeking adequate treatment — ranging from the prevalence of misdiagnosis to the lack of access to adequate medical care — stigma in the Black community still remains an insidious culprit.The Black community, and truly all communities, can engage in four activities to help get rid of stigma around mental illness.Stigma stems from a lack of knowledge, and the best way to fight a gap in information is by educating others in our community. There are numerous public resources on the different types of mental illnesses. Personally, I turned to resources on websites for the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance, National Alliance on Mental Illness and Mental Health America.These were helpful places to start because they provided me with basic information and helped me recognize the negative preconceived notions I had about mental illness. They also directed me to places where I could learn even more. I also sought advice on what to read from the mental health professionals in my life, which I suggest everyone do as well. I read so many books and articles that, eventually, I had the language I needed to speak about my mental illness.I have noticed that, in our community, we often equate strength with being silent and stoic — and that speaking up and asking for help is weakness. I believe the opposite is true. That’s why I have chosen to be open with my family and friends about living with a mental illness — and I emphasize the fact that I have won prestigious fellowships, scholarships and awards in spite of it all. I’ve also written about seeking help after experiencing a traumatic event.Living with a mental illness doesn’t define anyone, nor does it limit anyone’s abilities. Showcasing our best selves — with mental health issues and all — reveals to some that we are just as capable as anyone else when it comes to leading a successful life.As more Black people open up about living with a mental illness, the closer we will get to dismantling the stigma in our community. There is genuine comradery found in knowing that I am not the only Black person living with a mental illness. Celebrities like Taraji P. Henson, Jenifer Lewis and Janet Jackson, among many others, have opened up about their experiences with mental illnesses ranging from depression to bipolar disorder. Henson even founded The Boris Lawrence Henson Foundation in 2018 in memory of her late father. The more we recognize that mental illness can affect anyone, from your next-door neighbor to your personal hero, the more real and less frightening mental illness becomes to our community.Believing people when they say they have a mental illness is vital to eradicating stigma. When someone has a mental health crisis or expresses emotional distress, telling them to simply “pray it away” or to “fix your attitude” isn’t helpful. Failing to consider that people do, in fact, live with mental illness — and being dismissive in our advice — dissuades people from coming forward with how they are truly feeling. This sometimes causes people to not seek appropriate medical help.These suggestions are just first steps when it comes to overcoming mental health stigma in the Black community. We must do better and be better when it comes to supporting other Black people living with mental illnesses, myself included. I hope my thoughts push discussions further and foster a more productive and positive dialogue. While not everyone in the Black community has a diagnosis, it’s important to keep in mind that mental illness can affect anyone, including our community.Brakeyshia R.

      "body": "As I reflect on my journey with mental health, both personally and professionally, I am reminded how stigma pervades casual conversation and language — and just how damaging this stigma can be. For as long as I can remember, I have heard people use mental health diagnoses to describe everyday scenarios, like temperature changes or when an individual expresses organic emotions that do not need to be defined or clinically labeled. These casual mentions of “bipolar weather” or “crazy individuals” are not just momentarily offensive; they have wide-reaching consequences that deeply impact the lived experience of people with mental illness.When I entered the mental health profession, I brought along my own history of trauma, which contributed to bouts of debilitating anxiety and depression. After leaving the Air Force and seeking treatment, I encountered some great (as well as a few not-so-great) providers. I learned what it felt like to be heard and validated; unfortunately, I also learned what it felt like to be labeled and reduced to a diagnosis.My personal experiences, both the good and the bad, led to a deeper level of empathy and understanding for the individuals I would encounter later in my career as a therapist. My own experience in the mental health care system fueled my desire to hold space and advocate for people with mental illness, who are active members of society deserving of equal treatment and a life without labels.After several years of working in the mental health field as a behavioral health technician, case manager and team lead, I returned to school to become a therapist. I will never forget the passion I felt when I wrote my letter of intent to submit with my application. I told my personal story and explained how this ignited my desire to become a therapist.Now, years later — after continuing to see the impact of stigma and labeling from “the other side” — I hope to discuss stigma from the eyes of a clinician.Navigating a world riddled with labels, judgment and shaming can be exhausting and disheartening for anyone. Naturally, feeling like our many qualities, talents and complexities have been reduced to a single word or label is hurtful. For people with mental illness, this compounds an already-challenging circumstance: Managing and seeking treatment for a mental health condition.As I have observed in my clients, many people feel reduced to the label of their diagnosis and the careless language others have used to describe them. This, in turn, often leads to:Oftentimes, I have found myself working with individuals who have struggled with thoughts of being seen as “broken” and “worthless” due to the impact that stigmatizing language has had on the way they see themselves.Ultimately, labeling individuals — whether out of frustration or a general lack of understanding — contributes to an unhealthy culture of stigmatizing mental illness. As a result, people with mental health conditions are unduly burdened by others’ perceptions.Unfortunately, stigma is not limited to clients’ personal lives; it often invades clinical settings.To this day, I cringe when I hear anyone in the mental health field use stigmatizing language, like the word “crazy,” or refer to clients by the name of their diagnosis rather than describing them as the human they are at the core. The use of careless language demonstrates a gap in appropriate education, and it underscores the importance of clinicians approaching their work with a trauma-informed perspective.Practitioners’ use of stigmatizing language does not simply impact their clients — it can also wreak havoc in the workplace and drive the fear of speaking up. For example, careless conversations amongst colleagues in a medical setting could impact a provider’s willingness to seek help for themselves out of fear of being labeled or judged in their place of work. Instead of disclosing the need for help with managing difficult emotions or previously diagnosed mental illnesses, providers may attempt to navigate these difficulties themselves — hoping to avoid being labeled as “too incompetent ”or “not stable enough” to do their jobs.While clinicians have a role to play in eliminating stigma in mental health settings, there are steps that all people can take to change our cultural attitudes toward mental illness. We can change the lived experience of people with mental illness by addressing hurtful labels, calling out reductive language and changing the conversation about mental illness in our own lives.A few ways of fighting the stigma include but are not limited to:Ultimately, the conversation surrounding mental illness does not need to be riddled with labels and stigma. It can be a hopeful and productive dialogue that highlights the bravery, diligence and resilience of people with mental health conditions.Joshualin Dean is a therapist in Tampa, Fla.

      "body": "This year marks a decade since I first sought treatment for my mental health. During my sophomore year of college, following nearly five years of chronic and debilitating migraines, I was referred to a school therapist. Shortly after visiting the school psychiatrist and therapist, I was diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Later, in graduate school, I was diagnosed with post-traumatic disorder (PTSD) following a sexual assault.Ten years after that initial therapy session, I have made strides in my recovery — and I continue to pursue therapy. Over the last decade, I have learned a lot about myself and about mental health. The following are my main takeaways from treatment that I hope to share with others who may be struggling.For much of my life, I spent every moment working or thinking about working. My career consumed my life. However, my time in therapy has given me perspective and specific relaxation techniques to calm my anxieties. Some of these techniques include imagining I am brushing my stressors off, emotional freedom technique (EFT) tapping and freewriting about anxiety in my journal. As a result, my anxiety, which I have named Mr. Peanut and talk to, visits far less frequently.On my most recent vacation to celebrate completing the seventh semester of my doctoral program, for instance, my anxiety stayed at home, and I truly enjoyed my vacation. This was largely due to my new coping skills and progress in therapy; I proactively wrote out a task list of my pending projects before the vacation and set up out-of-office notifications so I could remain anxiety-free throughout the trip. Previously, I would have spent the trip stressing about my self-imposed, never-ending to-do lists and checking my work email. Instead, I enjoyed food, TV shows and shopping — without the normal intrusion of worry and anxiety.Ten years into therapy to address my anxiety, I only experience migraines once monthly, at the most. Yet, there are still hours or days when my panic attacks, disassociation or OCD get the best of me. During these times, I find myself ruminating about my tasks lists and client projects, catastrophizing or feeling like I am completely out of my body. However, over the years, I have come to understand that progress is not always linear, and my recovery is a lifelong journey.With this perspective, I finally feel equipped to deal with any mental health challenges that come my way. Now, I possess the confidence and faith that any mental health struggles I face are temporary and will pass — just as they always have.I used to be afraid to talk openly about mental health and to share my story, largely due to the stigma surrounding mental illness (and the resulting discrimination). However, with practice, and with the encouragement of those around me, I am now able to proudly share my mental health journey with friends and family, coaching clients, with large audiences and even with global publications.While I am proud to be reducing the stigma associated with mental health, I also found that sharing my story is critical to my recovery. Sharing my story of recovery soothes Mr. Peanut and reminds me that I am not alone.In fact, I was so impacted by the power of sharing my mental health story that I decided to write my doctoral dissertation on the influence of mental health self-stigma and mental health storytelling on college students.If you are struggling with your mental health, please know that help is available, recovery is possible and sharing your story can make a positive difference in the lives of those living with mental health conditions.Kyle Elliott, MPA, CHES, is the founder and career coach behind CaffeinatedKyle.com.

      "body": "It happens to me a lot when I talk about my depression. Someone will suggest that I “be grateful” for the wonderful life I have. By acknowledging the many positives in my life and by expressing gratitude, they reason, I won’t be “so depressed.”I fully acknowledge that I have an amazing life, and I’ve always had what I needed. But having my basic needs met — and even having wonderful things and people around me — does not “solve” my major depressive disorder, anxiety and personality disorder. Frankly, when dealing with the challenges of mental illness, it can be difficult to feel and express gratitude.This increasingly common notion that a good mindset overpowers a mental health condition is a biproduct of an increasingly toxic positivity movement. “Good vibes only” is a catchy phrase, but it fails to consider the painful and even dangerous reality of depressive episodes. This type of “positivity only” thinking can aid in ignoring your problems and hiding uncomfortable emotions.Managing multiple mental health conditions while trying to live a full life can be an emotional, physical and logistical challenge. I fight hard every day to get out of bed, take care of my kids, manage the household, write for a newspaper, run my blog and volunteer for NAMI Greater Corpus Christi. Some days are more of a battle than others, and I can never simply “forget” about my depression — or how it affects my life and my family’s lives.Despite these challenges, I do count my blessings every single day. But I realize that having a positive attitude, while helpful, is not a cure. No matter how positively I think, I will continue to experience a chemical imbalance and symptoms that are not cured with willpower. Optimism and hope are important — but being realistic about my challenges and limitations is important, too.Moreover, not feeling gratitude when you’ve been instructed to “be positive” can lead to feelings of guilt and shame, ultimately making a depressive episode even worse. When someone is struggling with a severe depressive episode, they should be focused on their self-care and survival — not feelings of shame and inadequacy.New evidence suggests that the positivity mindset may not be as effective as we once thought. In 2020, Ohio State University released an analysis of 27 studies on gratitude in which they examined whether the practice actually reduced symptoms of depression. Ultimately, they found that impact of gratitude interventions on depression is more limited than past research suggested.Their conclusion resonated with me. When you’re in the throes of mental illness, like a depressive episode, it changes you — you lose interest in your hobbies, you isolate from family and friends, you can’t always practice good hygiene. Often, you’re so sad that you think you might break into a million pieces and attending to any responsibilities, like going to school or work, feels unsustainable. I understand why people aren’t always grateful. Perhaps the supposed “power of gratitude” doesn’t serve them at the time, and that’s ok.If you’re struggling with your mental health, don’t allow well-intentioned but uneducated comments to convince you that you’re ungrateful — and, even if you’re not feeling grateful, do not allow the opinion of others to influence your view of yourself. Millions of people in the U.S. live with major depression (and other mental health conditions), yet mental illness is still shrouded in stigma and misinformation. What we need is a cultural shift from toxic positivity to education and compassion. Shaming those who are struggling breeds more negative emotions — and we don’t need to compound our struggles.You can be both depressed and grateful — and don’t let anyone convince you otherwise — but you’re entitled to days where you don’t feel grateful at all.Sometimes, you will have days where counting your blessings feels impossible. This does not make you a bad person; it means you’re busy fighting to live your life. Not everyone sees this battle you wage in your body and mind. But I see you. There is a community that sees you. Keep fighting. Keep counting your blessings if it helps — and don’t count them if it doesn’t. The only thing you need to do is take care of you to the best of your ability, whatever that may be.Heather Loeb is the creator of Unruly Neurons, a blog dedicated to eradicating the stigma of mental illness.

      "body": "Over the last couple of years, a moral panic has arisen over how to treat children and adolescents with gender dysphoria. Many anti-trans activists have questioned, and even sought to ban medical transitioning for those under 18, reducing the issue to an intellectual debate — as if, with enough talk therapy, trans identities can be eliminated.The reality is that this kind of discrimination has never been confined to the political sphere; the mental health profession and trans people haven’t really had a rosy relationship, and acceptance of trans identities within the profession is fairly recent. My own attempts at getting help for gender dysphoria tell a story of how difficult it was — and in some places, still is — to even talk with a therapist about gender identity issues.I was 16 years old the first time I tried to tell a therapist about my gender dysphoria. It was 1998, and I had originally gone to my therapist to sort out a recurring obsessive fear of what happens in the afterlife. Ever since my grandmother passed away when I was 12, I had relentless, spiraling anxiety about what happens to your consciousness after you die.It got to the point where I would often wake up screaming from nightmares about my brain just blacking out for all of eternity. My parents tried everything. I spoke with my school guidance counselor about it, and I even consulted my Catholic priest, who told me, “If there’s no afterlife, then Catholics are the world’s greatest fools.” The quote will stay with me for the rest of my life.Eventually, my death-related anxiety problem escalated to where we all agreed I needed some professional help.After about a dozen or so appointments with a younger therapist in my small New England town, I eventually felt comfortable enough to begin talking about my gender stuff. I say “gender stuff” because, at that time, I didn’t really have words to describe what I was feeling: An intense longing to be a girl. It was something I had felt for years, but everything I ever read about it was so alienating.First, I hit up the family encyclopedia, and eventually online forums to try to figure out what was “wrong” with me. I found scary sounding words I stumbled upon, like “transvestite” or “transsexual,” alongside unfamiliar definitions that implied I was some sort of sexual deviant. I was horrified and decided never to tell anyone.Until I met that first rural Massachusetts therapist. “I sometimes feel comfortable wearing girl’s clothes,” I remember telling her. She tried to ask composed follow ups, but the initial twisted look that flashed across her face gave away her feelings. Eventually, she seemed to almost shoo away discussion of my gender stuff, instead of insisting that I immediately tell my parents how I felt, a step I didn’t feel ready for yet.After a few more appointments, my therapist mysteriously stopped scheduling appointments for me. I tentatively told my mom, and even showed her some of the clothes I had stashed away in the back of my closet. But a few weeks later, I freaked out about it and told her it was just a phase and to please forget about it. The afterlife panics returned every couple of years, to the frustration of my loved ones.The second time I told a therapist about my gender dysphoria was when I was an adult. I had a panic attack on the way to work which I mistook for a heart attack. Instead of driving to work, I went to the local ER, which sent me to a walk-in psychiatric clinic across the street after determining that I did not, in fact, have a heart attack.The pattern was familiar. A few weeks into regular appointments with a therapist there, I tried bringing up my gender stuff again. My therapist at the time was a lesbian, but I could tell my gender stuff was an uncomfortable topic for her. She always tried to steer the conversation away from it.I left the practice frustrated and even more determined to never leave the closet. The afterlife panics only grew in frequency and intensity after that. I would say that I was never suicidal — in fact, part of my phobia was an intense fear of blinking out of existence for eternity — but death was nevertheless frequently on my mind. It was not healthy.In the summer of 2015, I finally broke and attempted suicide. Only a seemingly random but well-timed phone call from my mom saved me from that fate. It was at that point that I knew that I had to get help with my gender stuff. I searched for a long time for a therapist I could actually talk to about my gender stuff, having already figured out that I was experiencing gender dysphoria.In the first minute of my first appointment, I blurted out that I was transgender. It was the first time I had ever used that word out loud to describe myself to another person. She smiled and said, “Okay, I can help you.” I almost collapsed from the relief.It would take another nine months or so before I could access Hormone Replacement Therapy and begin the process of coming out, which wrecked my marriage and totally upended my family’s life. But funnily enough, the death-related anxiety also disappeared at that point.I know now that the two were related, and part of my obsessive thought process was worrying that if I died, my male form would be attached to my soul for eternity. Transitioning fixed that anxiety for me. At first, I thought it may have grown from my Catholic upbringing, but I’ve since heard from a bunch of other trans people that this fear of being bound to the wrong body is common for closeted trans people.It’s easy to sit around and declare that children don’t know themselves, and that you have to lead children to where you want them to go, but that’s not really true. Trans kids will opt out and continue hiding once they catch a whiff of hostility from their parents or mental health professionals — as I did. Instead, we need to be listening to trans kids and allow them the space and respect to determine the path that will get them help.Katelyn Burns is a freelance journalist and columnist at MSNBC.

      "body": "When I’m arranging flowers, I first pick out the greenery, often branches with full leaves, like the pepper tree or the viburnum bush. Then I choose a flower that intrigues me, usually one that yields many colors, depending upon how and where I look at it. I allow the colors to guide my next movements. I follow my eye, and trust that something will emerge. I build something — a tiny garden. A finite space constructed by me, made of nothing but water and plants.I don’t think this process differs too much from therapy. It’s most often when I’m creating that I’m able to make space for new meaning to live by. It’s often when I’m following a feeling that I am able to tap into the undercurrent of where that feeling was born. I think what we’re doing when pursuing self-work — whether it be through therapy or another route — is making space for our inner wisdom to reveal itself to us.I moved to California for graduate school, to pursue a degree in Expressive Arts Therapy, and I left a life behind. The voice of fear — my inner critic — predicted the pervasive loneliness, the heartbreak, the invisibility I’d feel during that transition. But it didn’t predict the wonder or openness that occurred underneath and past those points of withdrawal, largely due to the healing and expressive work I was doing. Using art to heal the memories of people telling me I could not be an artist allowed me to better connect with my clients.During my first year in the graduate program, for a student-led presentation on the unit of drama therapy, I put on a one-woman play in which I portrayed myself and my mother. It was six minutes long — nothing fancy. I chose to reenact a time when my mother called me a failure, and a time when we laughed together, in the car, on the way to New York, when she pretended to be a puppet who organizes the pantry by eating all the food inside of it. I shared the time when she’d written to me that I am much of what she would like to be; someone she feels she is not. I overlaid these short scenes with narration — words about how far away I felt from her, and how close I felt to her, at once. Through this exercise, I was able to express the grief of that confusion — loving someone who loves, hurts, understands and doesn’t understand you.I performed this in front of my classmates and teacher, who, afterwards, made me pieces of artwork called “aesthetic responses.” In the expressive arts world, aesthetic responses are, as they sound, artistic acknowledgements of what’s been shared. But, unlike feedback, it’s a process of giving back what was given to you. A moment of vulnerability for a moment of vulnerability. A movement, a painting, a song, a word, a flower.When I performed that six-minute play — a brief, truthful snapshot of a relationship — I was met by witnesses who received me by giving something back to me. This reenactment of my past, and the reciprocal process of sharing with a class, was a healing moment. Healing, like trauma, is a rearrangement. Being witnessed, absorbed and celebrated facilitates the process of rearrangement, and sometimes when it begins, you’re left only with water in a vase, and it is scarily blank.After this first performance, which resulted in many others, I noticed myself change and rearrange. Sharing became easier. Showing myself became easier. In my work with clients, when I invite them into a role play, or a performance of any kind, I work with their resistance. Often when there is little resistance, and they perform a scene or a feeling, I notice movement within our relationship.Recently, a fellow therapist and I were talking, and he told me he’s been in therapy for five years. He explained the first year of therapy as “getting beyond agreeability and the niceties.” The subsequent years, however, provide the tension — the intimate and awkward spaces in which he can occupy anger and withdrawal toward his therapist, without his therapist getting angry or shutting down in return.His interpretation stuck with me as I began practicing with my own clients; consistently approaching a client with compassion creates a sense of security — a new attachment in which expression is not punished but celebrated. Most of my clients enter the therapeutic space calling themselves “bad artists.” However, this would change over time as they continued to make art and understand the feelings that reside within their work. They would even be excited to show me what they’ve created. The voices of old art teachers who demeaned their expression faded away, replaced by a new voice of celebration.I decided to join an expressive arts women’s group, held by a former teacher of mine — a Mexican woman who had studied alongside indigenous women healers in Mexico called curanderas. There were large pieces of paper tacked onto the walls of the studio room. She had laid out bottles of paint, brushes and trays. I’d paint with red, black and gold; tons of jagged black lines. When feelings of rage arrived, I’d slap huge swaths of red onto the paper.Painting frequently and repetitively alongside other people created a kind of energetic field I still can’t fully describe. The huge and tiny movements of my arm, the sound of brushes touching paper around me, the feeling of being immersed in expression — it began to move something inside. I’d return the next week with a layer peeled back, and the next week, another, until I began to realize how deep my grief was. When I think about grief, I imagine many pools in the ground, and when I jump into any one of them, there lies a larger body of water underneath. I often tell my clients that we must jump into these pools in order to see how deep the water goes.Expressive Arts therapy, to me, is not simply about making art. It is about healing past traumas, quieting the voice of the inner critic and making space for expression and creation. But beyond that, it is about the process of following. It de-pathologizes the therapeutic process, uses metaphor to create safety and distance, and does not have rules. As someone who has never enjoyed following rules, it is essential to me that my work with clients does not get stuck within a model based upon what I “should” do. “Should-ing” is not involved in this process; movement is.Abby Taskier is an Associate Marriage and Family Therapist at Axis Mundi Center for Mental Health in Oakland, Calif.

      "body": "During P.E. in my sophomore year of high school, the coach had the class stand up in a circle. “Take everything off your wrists,” she commanded. A few teens had bandanas and wide bracelets on; they took them off. “Now, lift your hands to the ceiling, wrists facing me,” she said sternly with furrowed eyebrows.Our coach was a short, assertive woman who we didn’t want to mess with. She examined each student’s wrists, frowning and shaking her head as she paused in front of some students longer than others. At the completion of the circle, she told us to sit down. She proceeded to talk to other teachers and coaches in the corner of the gym, their faces contorting in apparent disdain and disgust.No one ever told the class what the purpose of this exercise had been. Those with secrets under the cloth coverings — those of us who were struggling with self-harm — knew. We were hiding the secret cries for help marked on our wrists. After the exercise, no adults followed up with the students who appeared to have injuries. In retrospect, this exercise seems to have been nothing more than forced exposure for the sake of gossip. I know there was no action to help the hurting teens because I was one of them.A year or two later, this coach became the principal of my school. When I needed mental health treatment, I spoke to this principal and poured my heart out, despite my past experience with her. She wrote everything down and nodded a lot. She gave no advice. Venting helped me feel a little better, but she offered me no solutions or support.She wasn’t qualified to give me the help I needed and should not have been the person I was sent to. I needed a trained mental health provider.Things have changed exponentially for students since I was in high school. My experience was before the year 2000, before social media and long before the COVID-19 pandemic. A study published in February of 2019 found that in 2016, half of youth with a treatable mental illness did not receive treatment in the past year.From the start of the pandemic, mental health related emergency department visits by youth aged 12 to 17 jumped 31%. With more than $190 million in pandemic relief funds going to schools, some funds should be going to addressing mental health issues. And some states, including Ohio, Georgia, Maryland and Arizona, are leading the way by using some of these funds to improve mental health care in their schools.While many of us remember having “school counselors,” as most schools have one on staff, these professionals are not necessarily employed to deal with mental health issues. Most often, school counselors help with academic success and career planning. Students also need school psychologists, who have specific mental health training, for when they are struggling with their mental health.This could be in the form of individual education planning (IEP) for disabled students to ensure they have the support they need or individual and group counseling. There is a critical shortage of school psychologists with an average of one for every 1,211 students in the U.S. The average public school has 526 students (that translates to one psychologist essentially being responsible for the care of 2.3 schools). Some states have a ratio of one psychologist to 5,000 students.As IEPs are legally required, it would be easy to understand if school psychologists only had time for these, and no time for counseling or staff collaboration, especially given these ratios. Some of the pandemic relief funds, among other school funds, could be used to hire more school psychologists to improve these gaps in care and prevention for students.Given the amount of time that they spend with their students, school staff members have the opportunity and responsibility to recognize and act on warning signs of mental health crises in students. Staff should be provided with and participate in trainings to learn the warning signs of a crisis and how to respond effectively. Better yet, staff should be educated on early warning signs before a crisis occurs.Perhaps most importantly, school staff must challenge themselves to combat internalized stigma surrounding mental health. If an education professional (and likely, a trusted adult) approaches a mental health situation with judgment, students may feel invalidated and replicate this stigma in their own lives. In contrast, if a teacher approaches mental health topics with compassion and empathy, they create a healthier culture in which students will ask for the help they need.Additionally, students should be given access to mental health crisis hotlines and mental health services within the school and the wider community.The CDC defines Social Emotional Learning (SEL) as developing the skills to recognize and manage emotions, learning to set and achieve a positive goal, learning to appreciate the perspectives of others, establishing and maintaining positive relationships, and making responsible decisions.This approach — which prioritizes self-awareness, self-management, relationship skills, social awareness and responsible decision making — is integrated into many school systems. Estimates suggest that schools and school systems spend about $640 million on SEL-related initiatives each year. However, while SEL can promote mental wellness, it is not a substitute for mental health treatment.While there are noted benefits of SEL, the need for school psychologists is arguably greater. Some SEL funds could be allocated to the foundation of mental wellness: mental health care and treatment. We need a ratio of more psychologists to less students. These trained psychologists should then act to educate both staff and the student body to recognize and treat mental illness in the school.My high school experience should have been different. I recognize that the coach and her colleagues may not have known how to appropriately handle the situation. That’s why this conversation is important. School staff members need to educate themselves on these matters for the safety and well-being of the entire community of their schools.I encourage parents to talk to staff and school board members, share concerns and ask questions. Everyone in the community has a vested interest in the care of students by way of their tax dollars and the shaping of their community. Even if you are not a teacher or parent, you have a right to learn, care and speak out about the students’ mental well-being in your community.Ginger Robertson is a registered nurse and mental health blogger.

      "body": "Glennon Doyle’s words echo in my head on repeat, “Find what breaks your heart and that will be your purpose.”On Sept. 8, 2017, my heart was not just broken — it was obliterated. On that day, I learned that my former partner, Alan, died by suicide. At 23 years old, Alan was one of 3,089 young men who took their lives that year.Before that call, I did not fully understand how the suicide crisis was not just a headline for LGTBQI youth and veterans, but an overarching pattern across generations, socioeconomic status and gender. That year, it was the eighth leading cause of death for men in the U.S. and the second for young people between ages 10 and 34.Since then, I have not been able to stop asking: How do we live in a country — in a world — where so many people choose to die? While this despair has led me to more questions than answers, there is something I have found to be absolutely true: Our current standards for treating mental illness are inherently flawed. Practices such as inpatient treatment, medication and talk therapy can be severely limited for many, and we must demand better.Throughout our friendship, Alan and I found common ground in various interests and life experiences: Our music tastes were nearly identical, we loved goofy and absurd TV (i.e., “Broad City” and “The Office”) and we both had our fair share of mental health struggles prior to meeting each other.During my last semester of college, I fell into what, at the time, felt like an indescribable rut. Over the course of a few months, I received various diagnoses, prescriptions and huge hospital bills. I felt my inner world collapse and found no promise in trying to stay alive in the external one, either.Looking back, what I really needed was rest, someone to hear my story, and connection to others experiencing something similar. Instead, mental health professionals told me my problems were solely biochemical in nature and that 15-minute visits with psychiatrists and new prescriptions would cure me. After multiple medication changes and two stints in a behavioral health unit, I quickly lost any hope that my mental health would improve.Thankfully, I was able to get out of this rut on my own. The same cannot be said for many, like Alan, who needed more care than what is currently available and lost their lives due to these significant gaps.The options for care can be expensive. While fees for talk therapy range anywhere from $75 to $150 — or much more, depending on the city, agency or private practice — there is no industry-wide standard for setting those price tags. Once medication is added to the mix, sessions with a psychiatrist are at least $200, but most likely double that value when the clinician specializes in certain diagnoses.Even when insurance can cover a portion of these fees, simply finding an in-network provider is a challenge. In 2016, NAMI released survey data that far too many patients are familiar with: Respondents were 80% more likely to encounter trouble securing a mental health clinician than a medical professional in any other specialty. For the uninsured and underinsured, covering those costs out-of-pocket is a direct path toward lifelong medical debt.When someone is suicidal or experiencing a mental health crisis, the options for immediate care can range from calling or texting a hotline to voluntary commitment to a psychiatric or behavioral health unit to involuntary commitment against their will to a similar facility or jail.What breaks my heart the most is knowing the options laid out for Alan, in his time of greatest pain, did not fit what he needed. Like Alan, so many of us are in those “in-between places” — when therapy and psychotropic drugs are not enough. Or when inpatient treatment represents an isolating and traumatizing experience that increases the person’s risk of suicide after discharge.My question is: What do we do for the people like Alan who need our help?While I can’t say for certain, I believe a human-centered and restorative care option could have been life-saving for Alan if it had been available at the time. Organizations like Garrett's Space, based in Ann Arbor, Mich., are founded by suicide loss survivors who are trying to address this need. Their mission is to create holistic and connection-based healing options for young adults in psychological distress. I believe the Garett’s Space model serves as a powerful and promising template for communities across the country, in addition to other efforts like Alt2Su, Project LETS and the Inner Compass Initiative.What all of these groups have in common is they center care around people with lived experience. They cultivate community rather than isolate and they empower patients instead of over-pathologizing them.We must ask the survivors of the mental health care system what is best (and what they wish their experience had been) and follow their lead. When our mental health care systems prove to be doing more harm than good, we need to question the system’s priorities and purpose, and we need to build anew.Julia White is a graduate student of social work at the University of Texas at Austin.

      "body": "Several years ago, I received an electronic toothbrush as a birthday present. An interesting gift perhaps, but also a fabulous creation; just one button and the bristles do the rest. In addition to giving me clean teeth, using the toothbrush leaves me temporarily unable to speak, hear, type or write — which, in turn, provides the perfect chance to let my mind wander twice per day.On one such occasion, I found myself thinking about dental care generally, and I began to wonder about how the field has evolved over the last century. It turns out that a specialty that once focused on treating severe problems with extractions now revolves around preventative care and education. This evolution struck me; I thought about mental health care and whether the approaches we use to care for our mouths could inform the ways we might care for our minds.One strategy that is central to dental care is lifelong, preventative self-care. Children learn at an early age that they should brush their teeth daily, and they are reminded to do so repeatedly until the practice becomes a habit. The result of this consistency is that many people continue taking care of their teeth for the rest of their lives — a practice that helps millions of people to avoid painful, costly dental procedures.I’ve often thought that similar preventative strategies could promote our mental health. Many possible approaches to daily maintenance of mental health exist. At the stage when we begin to teach brushing and flossing, we could also teach children how to use breathing techniques, physical exercises and communication skills when they feel overwhelmed or anxious — and we can remind them to use these coping skills when appropriate.Teachers, parents and caregivers could impress upon children the importance of self-care and encourage kids to take time for themselves, monitor their feelings, talk openly about their challenges and provide support to their peers. While preventative efforts promoting mental health are already out there, expanding those efforts, especially at an early age, could enhance coping skills and improve overall mental health.Daily self-care is not the only kind of prevention used to achieve better dental health. We are widely encouraged — again from a young age — to visit a dentist for regular check-ups, as often as twice a year. The purpose of these appointments is not to treat dental problems; it is to prevent those problems from arising in the first place. During these appointments, dentists have a variety of cavity prevention methods, including fluoride treatments, sealants, x-rays, professional cleanings, and new toothbrushes and floss, to name a few.Again, similar strategies would promote mental health. Mental health professionals are growing in number, and with the adoption of telehealth, care is increasingly accessible. Practitioners come from increasingly diverse backgrounds, embrace a range of theoretical orientations and specialize in a wide variety of techniques. However, most people do not consult a mental health professional until after they experience a mental health challenge or crisis. When compared to dental care, this begs the question: Would people benefit from regular mental health check-ups even if they are not experiencing a more serious issue?There is evidence to suggest that people would benefit significantly. Regular appointments would encourage people to reflect on their mental health and to think critically about what challenges they are facing. Moreover, the average time between a person’s first symptom and intervention is 11 years. Thus, regular check-ups would provide an earlier opportunity to assess how someone is doing, identify potentially harmful behaviors, suggest coping mechanisms and provide information. When necessary, a regular check-up could also help connect people needing a higher level of care to the appropriate services.One significant benefit to regular dental check-ups is identifying people at greater risk for more significant problems, such as spotting early signs of tooth decay or gum disease, and responding before more serious issues arise. Providing dental care to large portions of the population also helps identify problems impacting a specific population so that community-based responses can be developed.Increasing the regularity of mental health check-ups could offer similar benefits by improving the ability to recognize and provide resources to vulnerable and at-risk individuals and populations. For example, a person who has family members with mental illness and may be at a higher genetic risk for developing symptoms themselves.It’s not uncommon to see illustrations in dental offices using before and after pictures to demonstrate the differences dental care can make — providing information and hope to people with similar issues by showing solutions to those problems exist.Similar approaches already exist to support mental health; for example, peer support, where people in recovery assist those facing similar challenges. However, there could be ways to increase the concept of peer modeling — or making it a standard part of any treatment plan — that motivates people to focus on mental health and believe in the possibility of recovery.Dental problems have never come with the kind of stigma that accompanies mental health issues. For example, most people would empathize, rather than judge someone, for having a toothache. This greater understanding might stem, in part, from the open discussion and normalizing of dental health from a young age. If so, it stands to reason that using these approaches might foster greater awareness and compassion, and reduce stigma, when people are facing mental health challenges.National attention to mental health has picked up in recent years, but much remains to be done to promote mental health and provide relief to those in need. Obviously, this complex and multifaceted challenge cannot be solved by a singular item, like a toothbrush. That said, thinking about mental health from a different perspective might provide new solutions — even when that different perspective is from one of our simplest daily routines.David Kouba is an attorney who has practiced law for almost 20 years.

      "body": "In her autobiography, CBS Sunday Morning anchor Jane Pauley reveals that she was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in her late forties. She also mentions that upon hospitalization for her symptoms, a doctor recommended she tell her employer that she was receiving treatment for a thyroid condition. Pauley goes on to describe the incident as “the only time in my life...that I experienced stigma.” Her comment highlights the pervasive nature of mental health stigma and how it affects individuals’ experience in the workplace.A brief look at certain public figures suggests that living with mental illness does not have to hinder success and innovation. Famed mathematician and Nobel Prize Winner John Nash lived with schizophrenia. Beloved Hollywood icon and “Star Wars” actress Carrie Fisher had bipolar disorder, and she eventually became an advocate who worked to destigmatize the condition and encourage others to seek help. More recently, Olympic gymnast Simone Biles opened up about her mental health battle while adding yet another medal to her collection.These stories demonstrate that people with mental illnesses are not only productive contributors, but that they can be leaders in their fields — assets to both society and the workplace. However, people with mental illness continue to face tremendous barriers to employment; namely, discriminatory hiring practices.The rate of unemployment is higher for people with mental illness than those who do not have a mental health condition (6.4% as compared to 5.1%). Both research and anecdotal evidence suggest that people with mental illness want to work, and that working is vital to their recovery, but they struggle to find employment and equitable workplaces.By adequately addressing the stigma surrounding mental health conditions and reforming hiring practices, employers can create a healthier environment for potential employees and help applicants feel comfortable disclosing their mental health history or asking for appropriate accommodations.As anyone who has applied for a job may recall, many job applications include a form in which applicants are asked to disclose their disability status (called the Voluntary Self-Identification Disability Form). According to the ADA, the employer cannot legally inquire about the disability during an interview.The form, in theory, is designed to prevent discrimination; it even states that the employer is required by law to hire qualified applicants with disabilities. However, there are significant problems with this method of disclosure.In the Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form, the applicant has three options:The “I don’t wish to answer” option, while theoretically included to imply that disclosure is a choice, arguably puts pressure on the applicant to answer yes or no, fearing that a failure to disclose will be perceived as dishonest or secretive.As it stands now, this current approach serves as an unfair screening process in which people with mental illness are forced to guess how stigma may or may not impact their hiring process and calculate how much information to share.Just imagine a person with a mental illness, who already battles self-stigma (an internalized shame that is common), preparing for a job interview with an employer who knows that they have a disability. In this scenario, despite the fact that the employer should not inquire about the details of the disability, the applicant might feel pressure to explain their situation in order to appear accountable and reliable. Thus, employers hold significant power over the applicant before they even walk through the door.Accordingly, one could say that the Voluntary Self-Identification of Disability Form is discriminatory. It arguably puts individuals with mental illness in a vulnerable position (albeit unintentionally) because many feel pressure to demonstrate that they are “mentally fit” for the job — something a person without a mental illness would not face.Perhaps most critically, this disclosure process could also impact a potential employee’s experience after taking a job.For employees who may need particular accommodations in the workplace, the best course of action is to request them before performance slides or behavior becomes inappropriate (for example, an employee with a mental illness might ask for time off to attend therapy appointments). Thus, the pressure to disclose one’s needs begins during the hiring process. However, this also puts applicants in a vulnerable position: This time, to gauge whether or asking for accommodations for a mental illness (despite theoretical legal protections) will result in discrimination and reduce the possibility of being hired.Applicants who state that they do not have a disability on their application, but know they will need accommodations in the future, can also find themselves in a precarious situation. To get an accommodation, they most likely will have to explain to their employer why they need it. The employer can also request medical records, which is legal if the employee asks for an accommodation after being hired. And it may be considered grounds for termination if an employee lied on their job application.The reason employees feel obligated to explain their disability is because they know that many employers are concerned about the financial responsibility and consideration that an accommodation requires. However, in most cases, accommodations do not cause the employer undue hardship, and it allows the person who needs one to be more productive and comfortable.Another reason employers would be reluctant to accommodate is due to special treatment stigma where coworkers begin to resent what appears to be favoritism by the employer. Sadly, stigma prevails, and candidates are fearful of resentment.Ultimately, applicants will not want to disclose their disabilities until the stigma surrounding disability and mental illness has been reduced. About 18% of workers in the U.S. report having a mental health condition in any given month, so it is imperative that companies pay attention to their employees’ mental health.If employers want to foster a healthy workplace, they should implement a stigma-free environment, and encourage employees to seek appropriate accommodations. To accomplish any meaningful change in the workplace, employers should educate themselves and their employees about mental health in the workplace and the lived experience of people with mental health conditions. Awareness would help employers have a better understanding of the potential employees' needs and prepare appropriately.Additionally an employee should not have to disclose their disability, nor should they explain their disability to get an accommodation. Rather, the process should simply require employees to present a doctor’s note that they have a medical condition — or the employer can contact their employee’s provider to confirm that there is a medical issue.Ultimately, attracting the best talent and maintaining a healthy workplace requires hiring many applicants, including people with mental health conditions. Addressing stigma and better understanding the needs of employees will improve the workplace culture, which in turn, will help create employee loyalty and commitment to the company.Joanna Connors is a recent graduate with a master’s degree in Management and Leadership, and she hopes to pursue a Ph.D. to study mental illness and unemployment further.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "While NAMI St. Tammany does not hold the key to resolving mental health crisis response, our NAMI Affiliate has made great strides in building a strong, successful crisis response model in a small community north of New Orleans. A staple of NAMI St. Tammany is resilience — we have found opportunities for growth even during challenging times.Rather than wait for changes in the system, we learn the needs of individual agencies and find a champion from within those agencies. These champions have been judges, legislators, mental health professionals, law enforcement officials, the media and family members. Then, together, we change the system from within.In 2005, following Hurricane Katrina, St. Tammany Parish experienced a massive growth in population — and this migration put a strain on community resources, exhausting the almost nonexistent mental health care system. Suicide rates within the region increased and mental health care budgets were cut across the state of Louisiana.Beginning in the 1950s, Southeast Louisiana Hospital was an essential state behavioral health hospital located in St. Tammany Parish. However, the state of Louisiana closed the facility in 2012. Local and state legislators, citizens and employees protested the closing, thrusting mental health care into the spotlight. Hundreds of patients were transported to two other long-term facilities in the state. It felt like the rug was being pulled from under an already fragile system.Despite the devastating possibilities presented to our community, NAMI St. Tammany worked with our state representatives and local government to search for new opportunities by leveraging the needs of people living with mental health conditions in our region with available resources. Starting with the local community, one-on-one conversations eventually reached national partners.As a result, the National Council for Behavioral Health and the Louisiana Public Health Institute completed the NAMI St. Tammany Behavioral Health Assessment, which helped identify the specific needs of the community. The assessment found that emergency rooms and law enforcement were over utilized for mental health crisis care.As a follow-up to the assessment, we formed the St. Tammany Behavioral Health Task Force to plan how to improve the behavioral health care in our community. NAMI St. Tammany was involved in helping form and drive the task force, along with government agencies, health care providers, consumer advocacy groups and social service organizations. Our intention was to create a recovery-oriented system of care.Through listening to experts and community members, we educated ourselves about the missing pieces in our behavioral health care system. From there, it was through building relationships that we laid the foundation to fill gaps in the continuum of care. In connecting these key elements, a collaborative change took place. NAMI St. Tammany became the convener, “the glue” that brought these systems together. This work evolved into the Safe Haven initiative, a crisis model system.On the site where Southeast Louisiana Hospital once operated, the St. Tammany Parish Government, partnering with NAMI St. Tammany and other stakeholders, began developing the Safe Haven Campus.Gaining the attention of funders, from local foundations to national corporations, has brought about key community programs, including the NAMI Day Center, a peer-led recovery program focused on individual and group work. The NAMI Day Center, which opened in 2017, became the first phase of the Safe Haven initiative.The second phase, due to open soon, is the Crisis Receiving Center, which will serve as a single point of entry for people in a behavioral health crisis, diverting individuals from emergency rooms and the judicial system. At Safe Haven, individuals will be evaluated, housed up to 72 hours and ultimately routed to the most appropriate care, treatment and resources. This saves the community costly use of the emergency rooms and jail, in the most humane and effective way.We are also building a training and education center, the first new construction on the Safe Haven Campus since the 1970s, which will house the NAMI St. Tammany offices. And lastly, a healing residential program for veterans called Cardinal Cove is currently in the early planning stages.In 2011, NAMI St. Tammany began working closely with the 22nd Judicial District Court (JDC) to identify gaps in the criminal justice system for individuals with mental illness.To create a more effective system, representatives from the judiciary, law enforcement and NAMI St. Tammany visited cities using the evidence-based Crisis Intervention Team (CIT) Training. Through these “field trips,” the STPSO brought CIT Training to their department in 2018 and established a dedicated CIT department to our district.NAMI St. Tammany Executive Director Nick Richard, a CIT Certified Coordinator, was awarded the Crisis Intervention Team Advocate of the Year for 2020 by CIT International. The award recognizes a family member or other community advocate who demonstrates exemplary active involvement with their CIT program. The partnership continues with the STPSO in their CIT Trainings for officers and staff.There are many ways in which NAMI St. Tammany has grown into a well-recognized go-to for mental health resources. Through outreach (including radio spots, newspaper and educational TV segments, local and national discussion panels, presentations, etc.), we provide awareness about the mental health climate of the community.At NAMI St. Tammany, we see a community need as an opportunity. Through listening, learning, educating, collaborating and relationship-building, we can establish — and reach — our goals. We can be a space that meets our community’s mental health needs.This article was written by the NAMI St. Tammany administrative staff, under the direction of Executive Director, Nick Richard.Note: This article was originally published in the Fall 2021 issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I used to experience bizarre, scary and even offensive visuals that told me an anxiety attack was coming. Most of the time, they started small and then got bigger. For example, when I was working at a school, a papier-mâché turkey took flight off the shelf in front of me. Often, when I was walking, I saw water rising around me almost covering my mouth and drowning me. While making dinner, I even saw a knife turn into a weapon and cut out my intestines.I’m not sure exactly when these visuals started. I have dealt with severe anxiety for nearly 20 years. When I got my first permanent job as a teacher in 2008, my anxiety became debilitating. I tried a variety of techniques to address my symptoms. I was prescribed two anti-anxiety medications, which did make some difference, but I continued to struggle. One holistic practitioner instructed me to take off my shoes and rub my feet on the floor to help ground me in the present. I understood how this exercise might be relaxing for some, but it didn’t help me. Nothing I tried really helped until I started Time Line Therapy.While trying to cope with my anxiety, I had the most success with mindfulness and exploring prayer and perseverance. I mediated on scripture and found comfort in its truth — and I often began my days clear-minded. However, during my morning commute, my anxieties would creep up again. When my symptoms escalated to an anxiety attack, I would struggle for the entire day. I would go home and watch TV, hoping that I would find relief.After years of struggle, I knew I needed to pursue other treatment options. One of my best friends from the east coast introduced me to Time Line Therapy (TLT), an approach that encourages a patient to explore their past experience and surrender negative emotions linked to their history. If successful, TLT allows people to transform their internal programming and move past their limiting beliefs.My friend raved about this method for a long time, and I saw powerful changes in her when she began TLT. As she addressed her own mental health with this method, her emotional well-being improved. I also noticed that she became more articulate, and her thinking became more complex. I hoped to see a similar transformation in myself, so I decided to give TLT a shot.The goal of TLT, I learned, is to heal at the unconscious level. It begins, however, with conscious, intentional work to determine underlying pain. Prior to my sessions, through deep self-reflection, I realized that I was lacking self-love. During our sessions, I would follow cues from my therapist and close my eyes to imagine a timeline of my life over my head, going back to before I was born and extending into my future.I would revisit memories (and imagine myself hovering above a point on my timeline) in which I did not feel self-love. Then, I would describe these specific memories to my therapist, who would, in turn, guide me to “release” this lack of self-love and the negative feelings it inspired. As I released this lack of self-love at various points on my timeline, my therapist and I would review what I learned from each memory. These lessons, which we call “learnings” have become mantras I can repeat in times of anxiety and crisis.During one episode of my anxiety, I was reminded of how far I’d come. As I was beginning to panic, my husband said, “You can do this. You know what to do. You got this.” I focused on his face — on his brown eyes, pools of melted milk chocolate — and his hands holding mine. Then I repeated my most recent mantra from TLT and I said to myself, “You are safe inside your body. You are safe outside your body.”TLT has also taught me to calm and ground myself by envisioning calming scenes and safe interactions. One image that I return to daily (usually at work) is a column of light — wide enough to fit two people in it. That light is my higher power who I call God. My friend is with me, and I can see her face. It is at peace and beautiful. I focus on the sound of my breath and picture an ocean and its waves, crashing with the rhythm of my breath. It calms me. I hit my thigh and say to myself, “I am safe inside my body, I am safe outside my body.” I gently open my eyes and am ready to continue with work at the call site.Now, when my negative visuals return, I am able to pause and repeat my mantras. From there, I can envision a calming scene and my anxiety lessens.While this therapy has given me transformative tools, I am also making changes in my work life to promote emotional well-being. Instead of interpreting my unsettling visuals as negative symptoms that will trigger strong anxiety attacks, I am choosing to understand them as my body telling me that I’m reaching my limits for the day — professionally and emotionally.Now, I can better address my needs; I have been working a part-time schedule of 32 hours a week and pursuing work that I really love, which is tutoring. I’m grateful that I can work, and I’m also grateful that I can stop when I need to.With the tools I have gained from Time Line Therapy, and my newfound ability to reduce the power of my visuals, I have hope for my future.Lisa Rose Dyal has her master’s degree in English as a Second Language (ESL).

      "body": "If someone you love experiences a mental health crisis, do you know where to turn for help? Would you call 911 hoping that the person who responds has been trained in de-escalation? Would you go to the hospital emergency room hoping that your loved one won’t be left to sit there for days? Too many people live in fear of what will happen when they reach out for help.Unfortunately, the statistics show that, too often, people in mental health crises experience tragic outcomes. According to The Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings, one in four people shot and killed by police between 2015 and 2020 were people with mental illness. More than 2 million people with mental illness are booked into our nation’s jails every year. And tragically, more than 48,000 people died by suicide in the last year.It doesn’t have to be this way. People who experience a mental health crisis deserve a mental health response, not a criminal justice response. When someone experiences any type of physical health crisis, they expect to be able to call 911 and receive an appropriate health care response from EMTs. NAMI is working to create a system where someone experiencing a mental health crisis can also have expectations to receive a crisis standard of care provided by mental health professionals.In the fall of 2020, Congress passed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, creating a nationwide number — 988 — for mental health and suicidal crises. The Federal Communications Commission has acted to make 988 available in every community by July 2022.*The upcoming rollout of 988 means that mental health advocates have an opportunity to push for not only crisis call centers that can respond to 988 calls locally, but the other components of a crisis response system (listed below). The argument for making these changes now is simple: When someone dials 988, we need to make sure appropriate mental health services are available on the other end to respond to a range of crises. We need more than a number.In 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) published crisis guidelines that outline a standard of care for mental health crises, including:Currently, very few communities across the country offer anything close to the standard of care for these services. Without adequate crisis response services, communities are left to depend on law enforcement and emergency departments that are often ill-equipped to help someone experiencing a mental health crisis.NAMI is advocating at the federal level for resources to help states and local communities expand their crisis services. Additionally, many NAMI State Organizations are working with partners to advance state legislation that will define the requirements around crisis services and ensure funding is available for these services.Many states are looking to charge monthly fees on telephone bills, which was outlined in the federal legislation creating 988, and is similar to how 911 is funded. For example, Virginia, Washington, Nevada and Colorado have all passed legislation that included these monthly fees.Ask Your Elected Officials to Support Mental Health Crisis ServicesAt the federal level, you can urge Congress to prioritize NAMI’s work surrounding crisis response by visiting our Advocacy Center at nami.org/crisisadvocacy and joining our efforts. At the state level, you can check with your NAMI State Organization to see if they are working on this issue and add your voice to their efforts.Reach Out to Your Elected Officials to Share Your StoryWhile data informs policy work, stories move policymakers. Your representatives in your local community, state capital and Congress need to hear from you. Many have never considered what they would have to do if a loved one was experiencing a mental health crisis, so hearing first-hand accounts of what you or a loved one have gone through can help them understand the gaps in our existing mental health system.These are the important points to hit in any type of communication with an elected official:Share where you live (so they know you are a constituent who lives in their district), your connection to mental illness and why you are writing/calling/meeting with them.Example: “I’m here to ask for your support for mental health crisis services.”Briefly (written in one paragraph or said in 30 seconds) share a little about your or your loved one’s crisis — what you experienced, how it impacted you and others, etc.Share what went well when you sought help. If it didn’t go well, share what alternatives would have made the experience better or led to a more positive outcome.Example: “I would have been less threatened if I was met by a mobile crisis team staffed by plain clothes mental health professionals, but instead, I was met by law enforcement officers, which made me panic.”Share where you/your loved one are today, focusing on things that are going well, if possible.Example: “Since her crisis, my sister got the help she needed to get well and stay well. Today, she lives on her own and is working toward her college degree.”Transition from your story to the larger issue you want addressed.Example, “After many tries, my family finally got my nephew the care he needed, but not every family is so lucky.”Let your listener/reader know what solution will help people in crisis.Example: “Making sure there is a range of services to help anyone in crisis, no matter where they live — including crisis call centers, mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization programs — will help ensure no one in mental health crisis falls through the cracks.”Close your communication by making a specific request.Example: “Please support [insert local initiative bill number or name], which will require all crisis services to be available and implement a fee on all phone bills to fund these services. Everyone deserves to be able to access the care they need when they are in a crisis.”Look for Opportunities to Share Your Story PubliclyWrite a letter to the editor in your local paper about why the mental health crisis system in your community needs to change. If there is a 988/crisis services bill moving through the legislature in your state, look for opportunities to testify and share your story with the legislative committees considering the bill.Engage Other AdvocatesTo reimagine our crisis response system, we will need support from a large variety of stakeholders. Engage other mental health advocates, but look beyond the traditional mental health community, too. Hospitals and emergency departments, law enforcement, EMTs — they all see the impact of inadequate crisis care and are natural allies.Seek out social justice groups, housing advocates, substance use organizations and others who intimately know what the impact is when our crisis system fails us. The more voices, and the more diverse perspectives, the further our message can reach.Be PatientChange doesn’t happen overnight. While some states are moving quickly, others will need more time to build support. 988 will go live next July, but even if mental health crisis services aren’t fully in place by that time, every small step forward is progress.NAMI advocates are here for the long haul, and we won’t rest until people experiencing mental health crises can receive a mental health response everywhere in this country.Hannah Wesolowski is the Chief Advocacy Officer at NAMI.Note: This article was originally published in the Fall 2021 issue of the Advocate.*988 will not be available nationwide until July 2022, but if you or somebody you know is in crisis now, get help by texting “NAMI” to 741741 or calling the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "As a 23-year veteran of a law enforcement agency, I have spent significant time reflecting on the mental health impact of serving as a first responder. In my two decades of experience, I have gained an intimate understanding of the mental health challenges that can arise from a high-stress (and even traumatic) job. I’ve seen how, if untreated, symptoms can worsen and lead to long-term illness.I began my career as a patrol deputy, where I responded to routine calls, as well as emergency calls for service. Later, as a field training officer, I worked with new recruits hoping to become law enforcement professionals. I was then selected to become a detective, where I investigated a variety of general crimes, including property crimes and crimes against people. I then moved on to different detective assignments throughout the office, including intelligence, special victim’s unit and specialized investigations.While incredibly rewarding at times, this career path took its toll on my physical and emotional well-being.Nightmares, insomnia, indigestion and worrisome thoughts plagued my daily life; my family bore the burden of mood swings, bouts of frustration and sadness. I found myself in an unfamiliar, mentally debilitating place. I couldn’t understand what was causing my symptoms — but I knew something was terribly wrong — and I was afraid to pursue answers.I considered reaching out for help, but fear and deeply internalized stigma stood in my way. In my work environment, my colleagues would view my symptoms as a sign of weakness. Further, my daily workload demanded my full commitment. The constant duties and on-call status never allowed the time for self-care, let alone seeking possible treatment. I felt overwhelmed and guilty; furthermore, my guilt was wrapped around my inability to keep going.The field I dedicated 23 years of my life to did not provide me support or encouragement to seek help. Thankfully, someone else did.I was speaking with my daughter one day on an unrelated subject, and she commented that, “everyone needs a therapist.” For the next few days, I contemplated what she said, and, ultimately, I decided to speak with a therapist. Although my insurance through my employer covers mental health care, I decided to pay out of my own pocket. I was afraid any insurance claims may raise red flags about my mental health and fitness for duty.I began working with a therapist and discovered I could speak freely and put my feelings on the table. I opened up about particular job-related difficulties I faced, like mood swings and recurring nightmares. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as well as PTSD, and my therapist and I determined that these conditions were a direct result of my current profession.While working with my therapist, I eventually got to a place where I understood why I had certain feelings that I previously couldn’t explain. For example, I learned that my work-issued phone brought me anxiety whenever it would ring, especially when I was “on call.” This was due to the uncertainty of what type of call I would be responding to as a detective with the special victim’s unit.With more work and reflection, I came to understand anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress (PTSD) were slowly impeding my ability to give myself care and love.I am not alone in my struggle to cope with the stresses of my job. As the data and my personal experience suggest, many first responders are dealing with the consequences of witnessing and experiencing trauma on a regular basis.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA) have found that depression, post-traumatic stress, substance abuse and suicidal ideation are prevalent among first responders; more than 30% of first responders develop PTSD.Only once I sought treatment did I learn that SAMHSA and the CDC provide research and data to help first responders acquire knowledge and awareness of mental health symptoms and treatment options. My hope is that other first responders will find and use these resources.Currently, I am still trying to work through my symptoms — and I wonder if I will ever have a good night’s sleep. I wonder if my spouse will ever have a night where she does not have to wake me from nightmares. I wonder if my daughter will ever stop worrying about me.I am new to the world of therapy, but it has given me a place of hope. I never thought it was possible to talk about my symptoms, but I am thankful that there is someone who wants to listen and assist me in my need for answers.The most important knowledge I hope to pass on is that every human being can benefit from talking to a therapist. I have found therapy to be imperative and a lifetime process. With hindsight, I would give anything to rewind — to start over and learn about how my career could debilitate my mental health and how therapy could change the trajectory. This greater understanding certainly would have improved my mental health and helped me on the job.While the saying, better late than never, describes my current journey, many first responders can’t wait to find answers.It is my hope that my fellow first responders will find encouragement from my story to reach out for help — to secure a good therapist and begin exploring the feelings that may have intruded on their lives and careers. Mental health is directly related to physical health; the two are intertwined and a truly healthy individual needs to address both.The author of this blog, who wishes to remain anonymous, wrote this piece for the Dawn Institute.

      "body": "Despite our nation’s growing diversity and the disproportionately higher rate at which people of color (POC) experience adverse mental health outcomes and barriers to care, the mental health workforce is largely white. According to a report from the American Psychological Association, 86% of U.S. psychologists in 2015 were white, and in 2019, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that close to 70% of U.S. social workers and 88% of mental health counselors were white.If you’re a person of color (POC), these statistics probably aren’t surprising. Trying to find a therapist who shares your racial or ethnic background can feel like a game of Where’s Waldo — and in mental health, a field where white saviorism often runs unchecked, the consequences of this lack of diversity, including the inability to adequately support the unique cultural needs and experiences of POC, are often ignored.Oftentimes, practitioners and policymakers question why it matters “who the help comes from” or they attribute POC’s low use of mental health services to cultural stigma. While plausible, this can be an incomplete way of thinking.As a mental health care worker and graduate student in social work, I’ve often wondered: What if the barriers to care that underserved groups experience is due to a lack of providers who POC can identify with and trust?I didn’t truly understand the importance of having a counselor or therapist I could identify with until I sought help myself. The handful of Asian-American therapists in my city already had waitlists. So, instead of talking with someone who understood my cultural nuances or the daily experience of navigating a white-dominated society as an Asian woman, I often carried the burden of educating white therapists about my identity. For example, I found myself tasked with explaining why a “normal” experience for a white person might be anxiety-inducing for me.Similarly, when I worked as a psychiatric nurse, my most vulnerable patients rarely encountered mental health professionals from their own communities of color or from similar cultural backgrounds — in addition to facing numerous other barriers in accessing care. Again, I witnessed the personal ramifications of this deficiency; my own mother lived in an area with a historically large immigrant population, yet she was unable to find a counselor or therapist who spoke her language when she was depressed.These issues are part of a larger problem in our country regarding the lamentable shortage of POC mental health professionals to match our increasingly diverse population.As of 2019, about 40% of the U.S. population identified with a racial or ethnic group other than white, and estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau suggest that the results of the 2020 census will indicate a record decline in our nation’s white population over the past decade. As the data shows, POCs already comprise a significant portion of our country’s population, and numbers are only projected to grow.More recently, mental health issues have gained national recognition, but we need to take action to create impactful change for this demographic.It’s true that more POCs are entering the mental health field than before, but we need greater numbers — in both urban and rural communities — to more accurately reflect the demographics of our country. To challenge this shortage, federal policy initiatives should actively recruit students of color to the mental health workforce, and grants provided at city or state levels could help expand mental health care services to local communities of color.Special focus should be taken to create job opportunities and recruit students from communities that have the greatest need for a representative mental health workforce. Federal funds can support students’ professional education through scholarships and the forgiveness of loans — and grants to schools, organizations, and/or agencies can support the creation of jobs and programs that promote students’ personal, academic and professional well-being. Grants may also be used to train diverse peer specialists — or individuals who have experienced mental health challenges themselves and provide support to those in need — from within local communities of color.Research shows that use of ethnic matching (pairing a client with a therapist based on race/ethnicity alone) is not always effective, and understandably so. This technique by itself is reductive and equivalent to saying a white client can connect with any white therapist.POC mental health professionals should be available to the extent that people of all backgrounds have the option to select therapists or work with professionals they feel best match their needs. By investing in a more representative mental health workforce, people of color can partake in more choices for their practitioners, and mental health care can hopefully become more accessible and equitable.Rebecca Kim is a graduate student in social work at the University of Texas at Austin with a background in psychiatric nursing.

      "body": "As an Indigenous psychotherapist who grew up in predominantly white spaces, I’ve come to learn the importance of connection and belonging as a part of healing. Being an active part of a community that allows us to feel seen is truly an invaluable feeling. When we feel seen and connected as humans, our healing expands.Our physical health and longevity are also greatly impacted by social connectedness; research has shown that social isolation may significantly increase a person’s chances of early death while strong social connection can lead to a 50% increased chance of longevity. I can only imagine this being even more impactful for Indigenous folks as carriers of ancestral trauma, generational trauma and historical trauma due to being separated from our community and the land.As I have undergone my own journey to find connection to my Indigenous community, I hope to share what I’ve learned.Throughout my life, I have been a part of many non-Indigenous communities where I experienced a sense of belonging — but I always felt as though something was missing. For example, I grew up in a small town in Wisconsin where I experienced what it was like to be a part of a small, tight-knit community. While I experienced connection and support in that community, it was different from the type of connection and support I felt when I was in community with other Indigenous Peoples. I’ve learned this is a common experience among multiracial folks; no matter what community you are a part of, you might feel as though you don’t fully “belong” in one space.It wasn’t until I was able to deepen connections with my Indigenous community, and the land, that I realized there was a part of me needing to feel seen as an Indigenous person. Lack of community for an Indigenous person is often felt so deeply because, culturally, a tribe as a whole represents “family.” In Indigenous communities, we see each other as relatives, no matter what our blood relation is. I have many aunties, uncles, cousins, siblings, grandmothers and grandfathers. As I strengthened these connections and felt seen as an Indigenous person while still learning about my own culture, I experienced a whole new sense of belonging in community.Community is a pillar of identity for Indigenous Peoples — it is coming together for ceremony, for mourning, for celebration, for gratitude, for harvest, for support, for everything.As I’ve continued to grow those connections to Indigenous folks around me, I’ve begun to feel an irreplaceable sense of belonging. Having this community of family and tradition has brought a whole different level of healing to my spirits.However, that is not to say my journey toward belonging has been easy. I still struggle with belonging even within my Indigenous community. One of the common Indigenous experiences contributing to the lack of belonging is not feeling “Indigenous enough,” something I’ve come across personally. This sense of inadequacy can manifest in many forms, from not feeling welcome to attend Indigenous ceremonies to worrying about rejection from other Indigenous Peoples. Often this is a painful, lonely experience, which can be difficult to name out loud, let alone to try to heal through.Despite the challenges, without these connections, I don’t think I would be the human I am today — nor would I have the capacity to continue my work as a therapist over the last two years. In fact, I don’t think I would have even had the confidence to write a blog post like this: A piece centering the Indigenous experience. And I am grateful that the opportunities to connect with the Indigenous community have expanded over time.Enter at your own pace — when you’re ready. There is no wrong way to start; the sooner you can begin seeing more Indigenous Peoples in your interactions, the sooner you will find what helps you feel connected. You can begin to search out your Indigenous community in several ways:You may experience a variety of intense emotions when engaging in community, especially if you take part in traditional songs, prayers and medicines. As you engage, notice what you feel most connected to, whether that be in person, virtual or a combination of both.Once you have established some connections, you can take the next few steps in deepening your relationship with the community by inquiring about how and where you can continue learning. Some things you could inquire about include:While feeling doubt or uncertainty about belonging is understandable, don’t let it hold you back. You can connect with Indigenous folks within your local community no matter what tribe you may be from. Making the first steps can be the hardest part. I often found a lot of relief in naming my struggles and nervousness to the Indigenous folks around me who offered support.Your community can have layers. For example, your family and friends are a part of your community whether they are all Indigenous or not. There is no right or wrong time to connect with people. In fact, it is best to move at your own pace as you build community as it will be the foundation to ground you throughout your healing journey.Stephanie Jensen is a Licensed Independent Clinical Social Worker, psychotherapist, private practice owner and social work licensing supervisor.

      "body": "Oftentimes, physical and mental health symptoms are deeply interwoven. Stress may give us headaches. Panic can feel like a heart attack. Receiving a long-delayed surgery may bring relief from physical symptoms as well as worry and anxiety.While we experience mental health symptoms throughout our entire bodies, our health care system has long separated physical health treatment from mental health care. This fragmented system can be notoriously hard for people to navigate, leading to unmet needs and poor health outcomes.So why don’t clinicians treat mental and physical health together? Increasingly, they are.The practice of addressing mental health needs in primary care or specialty care settings is often referred to as mental health care integration. It can also be called behavioral health integration, collaborative care or integrated care. Regardless of what the approach is called, the goals are the same: Treating the whole person to optimize their overall health. This growing and much-needed practice is a model of care that NAMI has and will continue to support.While there are a variety of approaches to integrating mental and physical health care, most models bring together physicians, nurses, social workers and therapists to coordinate and address individual’s health needs holistically. Treatment services can be offered in the same physical location or through shared treatment plans when providers are not in the same location. Ideally, these approaches would use person-centered care, where individuals, and often their families, participate and actively engage in their treatment along with their health care team, and that team respects their wants, needs and preferences.The popularity of integrated physical and mental health care models increased gradually in the 1980s as more general medical providers began treating mental health conditions. Several forces in the past three decades have propelled mental health integration further ahead, including:By 2017, Medicare, which provides health insurance to Americans ages 65 and older and many people with disabilities, created new payment opportunities for physicians who integrate primary and behavioral health care. In 2019, Walmart opened its first clinic offering primary care and mental health services for shoppers in Georgia.The benefits of mental health integration are numerous. Individuals often feel more satisfied because they are able to address more of their health needs in a single, familiar setting. Health care providers appreciate having more “hands on deck” — specifically, more mental health professionals — to address concerns that their medical team cannot. Integrated care also helps ensure that people are receiving the right care at the right time, which can improve outcomes and reduce costs.Addressing StigmaMental health integration can also help address the stigma associated with receiving mental health care. Some people may hesitate to raise their mental health needs with a primary care provider, and that hesitance can unnecessarily delay treatment. Having a primary care provider ask about feelings of stress, anxiety or depression as part of the standard routine check-up can help normalize and de-stigmatize mental health symptoms and corresponding treatment.Accessing CareFor many, primary care is the first place to turn for a physical or mental health need, making it a convenient opportunity for practitioners to ask about and screen for symptoms of mental health conditions. This practice can help identify symptoms earlier, which leads to earlier treatment intervention. Integrated care can also make it easier to find and connect with a mental health professional through a medical provider’s referral, especially for more complex mental health needs.Preventing Physical Health ConditionsWe know that about 20% of adults in the U.S. experience mental illness each year. And millions of people in the U.S. have both a mental health and physical health condition. Sadly, people with serious mental illness die earlier than their peers without mental illness, but the vast majority of these deaths are due to chronic physical conditions such as cardiovascular, respiratory and infectious diseases, diabetes and hypertension. Mental health care integration has the potential to help address the physical health needs of people with mental illness by encouraging people to receive preventative care while treating their mental illness.The road to a more fully integrated health care system has its share of challenges, including capacity, technology, interest, sustainability, training, insurance reimbursements, complexity and workload. It remains an under-utilized model of care. Not all health care providers or health care systems have the financial resources, tools or workforce needed to add and sustain integrated care.Still, mental health integration offers a promising solution to addressing the individual’s total health needs, while improving health outcomes, reducing health care costs and enhancing quality of life. It also provides the opportunity to offer person-centered care.NAMI believes that all people with mental health conditions deserve accessible, affordable and comprehensive health care. NAMI supports the use of coordinated care models that integrate physical and mental health services and will continue to advocate for its expansion.To learn more about our advocacy and how you can get involved, visit nami.org/advocacy.Jodi Kwarciany is the Senior Manager of Mental Health Policy at NAMI.Note: This article was originally published in the Fall 2021 issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "My first episode of psychosis arose from a brutal depression. A verse began playing in my head — from a voice that was male, angry and loud. I would later learn that this was The Voice of my psychosis, returning each time my symptoms did. He chanted in a deep timbre and his lyrics took on a mesmerizing rhythm.“You are the charmed one\nYou are evil incarnate\nYou will vanquish evil\nYou are invincible.”This episode, and the series of psychotic episodes that followed, occurred in the 90s. However, it wasn’t until I started working with a psychiatrist, Dr. Lev, in 2005 that I disclosed my experience. When I began working with this doctor, I was in the midst of yet another episode of suicidal depression, and I endured six inpatient psychiatric admissions over 18 months. During this prolonged episode, the bouts of psychosis returned.I needed to know I could trust Dr. Lev — that she would believe me, and she wouldn’t laugh at what I was revealing. My fears are not uncommon; people with mental health conditions are often hesitant to let others know they are experiencing psychosis.As my experience suggests, addressing this symptom can be a challenging and isolating experience. However, learning to trust my doctor and working with her to find the right treatment plan has been key to my recovery.I often revisit my experience by reading files from my hospitalizations. An excerpt from an admission note to an inpatient treatment facility in September 2005 read, “patient describes hearing messages coming to her from the radio, somber music playing and commentary voices.”When those of us who live with psychotic depression are experiencing delusions, we are often aware our thoughts are unreal, though there may be an element of doubt. This knowledge can feel terrifying as we wonder if we are gradually crossing the line from “sanity” to “insanity.”In March of 2014, during one inpatient stay, a psychologist interviewing me inquired about psychosis, and I hesitated, falling silent and lowering my eyes. As I stared at the floor and played with my sleeve, I revealed to her that my room in the hospital was freezing, and I believed the maintenance men were following an unknown executive’s orders, purposefully blowing cold air through the vent up from the basement trying to freeze me out.Each spring, Dr. Lev took a vacation to Europe for three weeks. Whenever she left for these trips, my mental health would deteriorate, and my intense fear of abandonment emerged. Each time, I became convinced she would choose not to return.In 2010, the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökul erupted, sending volcanic ash over nine kilometers into the sky. Europe experienced air travel chaos for almost one month. I became convinced that my desire to prevent my doctor from leaving was so strong, I’d caused the volcano in Iceland to erupt, preventing her from flying to Europe. Part of me knew I couldn’t possibly have triggered the volcano thousands of miles away. However, I feared that there was a fragment of my psyche that was conspiring against me. I could feel the gears grinding in the depths of my brain and The Voice rising to just under the surface taunting me:“It’s all your fault.\nYou know you wanted this to happen.\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself.\nYou’d better not tell.”Eventually, I did confess my delusion to my doctor, and we explored the root cause of my fear of abandonment (and my enduring terror she would decide to permanently stay in Europe). In disclosing the delusion, I also feared The Voice would punish me for divulging our secret. I revealed to her if she didn’t return, I didn’t think I could survive without her.Admitting how dependent I’d become on her made me feel as though I was a child begging a parent not to leave. However, she did not laugh or stop seeing me due to my attachment — she stuck with me and helped me find the medication regimen that kept The Voice at bay.My regimen of psychotropic medication includes two antidepressants and one of the second-generation antipsychotics. I take these on an ongoing basis, not waiting for an episode of psychotic depression to occur first. Dr. Lev and I feel that it’s critical to be proactive due to my history and genetic predisposition.It’s been almost a decade since I’ve suffered a severe depressive episode with psychotic features — a decade since I’ve heard The Voice — for which I am thankful. I’m also acutely aware for a person with my history, there are no guarantees. There seems to be no rhyme or reason to how my psyche functions — and even though I worked hard in therapy to gain insight into self-sabotaging patterns and behaviors, there is so much we don’t know about the brain.There are days I feel the ground is solid beneath my feet, and there are days I feel the soil shifting and it’s as though the ground might swallow me into a world of unreality. Staying right side-up requires working hard every day, listening to my doctor, using the insights I gained in therapy and trusting my brain won’t betray me.

      "body": "I have worked in the mental health field for almost three decades. I began my career working at a mental health center as an outpatient therapist for children and adolescents who had received treatment in a residential facility.After 14 years, and earning my doctorate, I moved into private practice, serving people of all ages. Many of my clients over the years have experienced debilitating anxiety, viewing life through a lens of fear. Often, I share with them my own experience, which has taught me that clinging to a comfort zone of familiarity and safety can limit one’s choices, relationships and experiences.As I look back over the years, I think about how my daughter has taught me to dive into all that life has to offer: New food, new people, new adventures, new countries, new plays, new museums, new concerts...the list goes on. I have learned to say “yes” to things I would never have dreamed of trying.She has taught me how the value of shared experiences with loved ones is more precious than anything — and she has even taught me to quiet the voice of anxiety that accompanies stepping outside of one’s comfort zone.We were at the end of a family vacation on the beautiful island of Maui. My daughter, Camille, hoped to pack in one more Hawaiian adventure: She wanted to take a sunrise bike tour in Haleakala National Park. At 6,500 feet high, bikers would view a glorious sunrise before riding 26 miles downhill from the slopes of Haleakala.In order to experience this once in a lifetime opportunity, we would have to wake up at 2 a.m. and drive for an hour to the bike shop where we would be suited in rain gear and helmets. My husband, son and my son’s girlfriend had no interest in getting up that early — and honestly, after reading further about the excursion, I began to have second thoughts. At 53 years old, I did not have Camille’s youthful energy.Against my better judgment, I woke at 1:30 a.m. and pulled on my socks. Memories began flooding my mind of so many previous adventures with Camille: Horseback riding, zip lining, repelling, swimming in a cave with stalactites, hiking, dancing, skiing and traveling. These memories are tied to meeting the most wonderful humans from all over the world who graciously shared their stories, kindness and assistance if needed. These memories are more precious to me than anything else I possess on Earth.By not allowing a nagging voice of anxiety to dictate my experiences, I have learned that my fear is fleeting and has diminished over time. What the hell, I thought to myself, I’m in.We walked to the rental car, and I wrapped my jacket tighter around my shoulders. It was cold, damp and dark. Shivering, I turned on the heat in the rental jeep as rain began to fall. I thought to myself, Oh good, the tour will be cancelled and I can crawl back into a warm bed. We arrived at the bike shop where we were given our biking gear and a brief overview of what to do and not to do on the bike.We found a seat together on the van, which was packed with other eager, early-rising adventurers. It was probably a blessing that the darkness, fog and continued rain prevented us from seeing much of anything. We were assured the rain would likely clear up and the sun rise would be dazzling as promised. Arriving at the very top, we all made our way into the National Park building. Camille and I slowly nudged our way forward to the large windows to view the magnificent sunrise. However, the rain and fog obscured our view. “This is a blast, and I love the view,” I joked.Freezing and damp, we trudged back in the rain toward the van. Again, we were reassured this is only temporary, and we will still be able to do the bike ride. I can’t wait, I thought to myself, nothing like riding down a slick road overlooking a 6,500-foot-high edge to make you feel totally pumped.When the van drove us down to where the ride would begin, the rain stopped and the sun came out, as if on cue. We were tasked to ride along a two-lane highway in the small space between the line separating us from cars zooming behind on our left and the abyss on our right. I spent the next few hours riding simultaneously in fear and exhilaration behind my fearless daughter. The views were indescribably beautiful and tears suddenly filled my eyes with gratitude that I am healthy enough to make this trek and share this amazing experience with my only daughter.Camille rode her bike without a care in the world, glancing behind periodically to make sure I was still alive — while I periodically yelled for her to slow down. Several hours later, we coasted back into the bike shop and peeled off our rain suits, now dried and stiff. I thanked God that I might actually live to see my next birthday. Camille told me how she would do the ride again. With a wry smile, I told her she is a sadist. But she knows the next time she suggests a new adventure, I will be all in.Though anxiety prefers that we remain in a cone of safety, avoid any unnecessary risks and keep everything the same as much as possible, we must resist. I will not let the fearful voice of anxiety limit opportunities for adventure and connection with those I love.Dr. Franne Sippel, EdD, is a licensed psychologist, a nationally certified mediator, co-owner of Northern Plains Psychological Associates in Aberdeen, S.D., and co-host of the mental health podcast, Shrink Rap the Podcast.

      "body": "Have you ever felt “weird” and disoriented — like the world around you wasn’t real? Did your surroundings feel like a dream? Were you scared or disturbed by this shift in reality? This disconcerting experience may be an instance of derealization (DR).Anyone can experience DR. Experts are still learning the underlying mechanics of derealization, but it can be triggered by several causes:When I experienced derealization, I distinctly remember experiencing my reality as if it were a dream. I would be walking down the road, caught up in my thoughts and, suddenly, the outside world would feel “off” and unfamiliar.One night, I ate some cannabis edibles recreationally, something I had done without incident many times before. For weeks, I had been feeling disconnected from reality; I couldn’t shake the feeling that everything was just a dream. After consuming the edibles, these inexplicable feelings intensified. I attributed this escalation to the effects of the cannabis and decided to sleep it off. When I woke up the next day, the feeling remained.In retrospect, I do not believe the cannabis was the trigger for my derealization. While there have been several cases in which people have consumed marijuana and felt unable to control its psychoactive effects — and this can lead to panic attacks and reports of feeling derealized — I believe that my DR had begun before I consumed the edibles. Over the next few days, the dreaming sensation returned several times. This feeling of “unreality” would grip me without warning.A few days after I experienced this intensification of my strange feelings, I was having lunch with my co-workers. After ordering my food, I suddenly felt as though something was “off.” Everything and everyone around me looked strange, but I wasn't experiencing any visual hallucinations. Rather, everything felt intensely odd to me. Over the next few weeks, this evolved into a full-blown DR episode that lasted a few years.I’d like to share my understanding of this symptom to help those who may be experiencing something similar.When I first began experiencing derealization, I was worried that my symptoms must be the start of something terrible. The experience can feel so strange and isolating. I (and many others who have been in my position) assumed that this feeling meant I was in serious danger.For some, the derealization can be a “one-time” event. For others it may be chronic — either experiencing intermittent episodes that come and go or experiencing feelings of unreality consistently for a long period of time. Naturally, people experiencing chronic disconnection from reality may fear for their safety and their futures.However, I’m happy to report that, even after all these years, nothing dreadful happened to me. I am recovered and living a fully functional life. None of my worst fears ever materialized.There’s a reason we feel this way. When we experience significant trauma or stress, our body and mind can dissociate. This is sometimes necessary to prevent feeling emotionally overwhelmed. Simply put, the body and mind disconnect; either from each other or from reality. This disconnection serves as a protective mechanism.My biggest fear during DR was that it seemed like the onset of psychosis. I worried that this state was actually the beginnings of schizophrenia or something more serious. However, DR is not the same as psychosis, and experiencing DR does not mean that you will develop schizophrenia.People with schizophrenia or psychosis commonly experience hallucinations or delusions that are difficult to distinguish from reality. Individuals with DR may feel strange about themselves or their surroundings, but they do not typically experience hallucinations or delusions. They are also more often aware that something is “off” and may have an easier time describing their symptoms as inconsistent with reality.It is important to note that people with schizophrenia can also experience derealization, but awareness of symptoms is key to help differentiate between the two conditions.Your first instinct may be to fight and resist the way you are feeling. Understandably, you may want to stop feeling “strange.” I felt similarly, at first. But little did I realize that it was my fighting these DR feelings that allowed them to last longer.As I’ve learned through personal experience, when we fight and resist the way we are feeling, we unnecessarily stress our body and mind. This stress produces more feelings of derealization, and your coping mechanism actually becomes a vicious feedback loop. The best way to end this loop is to stop fighting these feelings, sit with them and try to accept them.This may sound like a terrible idea at first. You may think that accepting and allowing these feelings could lead to losing touch with reality. However, this is not the case. Once you start to relax and let go, you can begin to heal from derealization.Whenever you experience DR, tell yourself that it’s ok to feel this way. Then, try to allow yourself to experience the sensation. Don’t judge or label it as something dangerous. Accept it and do your best to continue on with your day. Of course, this will be hard in the beginning, but once you are assured of your safety, you will have an easier time letting go and healing.Once you follow the path of acceptance, the best thing is to keep moving forward. I understand that DR can restrict your life. You may not feel like the same person you were a few weeks ago. You may even feel lost, scared, depressed or hopeless.I remember the fear and uncertainty. However, in the end, I managed to find courage and hope and keep moving forward with my life. Once I became assured that I was not in harm’s way, I stopped fighting my symptoms. I began to slowly let go. I tried to live my life as normally as I could, even amid frequent symptoms.It helped me to take small strides and accomplish simple tasks every day, to develop healthy habits and stick to them, to educate myself about this condition, to practice acceptance and to continue living a healthy, productive life. Recovery from derealization takes time, so patience is key, but I am living proof that it is possible.Swamy G once suffered from depersonalization and derealization but made great strides in his recovery.

      "body": "As I’ve progressed in my eating disorder recovery, I have chosen to be very open with friends, family and others about my struggles. I have dealt with anorexia, and I have several very close friends who have histories of disordered eating, specifically binge eating. Discussing our challenges and gaining a better understanding of each other’s experiences has been enlightening.Understanding how other disorders are perceived — and how stigma varies depending on the type of eating disorder — has given me insight into how my friends’ lived experiences vary from my own.I hope that sharing my story and what I’ve learned from my friends will help normalize discussions about eating disorders.As is typical for those with anorexia, I sometimes restrict my food intake, denying my body the nutrients it needs. My body often responds to this restriction with headache or hunger, which, I understand, can be alleviated with food. But historically, I have tried to eat the least amount possible to satiate the hunger.This restriction, unfortunately, is often encouraged by a cultural prioritization of thinness and “restraint.” People who restrict, I have observed, are often praised for their disordered behaviors. They are complimented for resulting weight loss or commended for their “self-control.”For those battling an eating disorder, this can be a highly dangerous reinforcement. They are denying their bodies the food that they need — a behavior that can be difficult to change on its own, let alone with the added reinforcement of impressing others.It’s important to note that there are people who will not encourage disordered eating behaviors. There were those who comforted me, encouraged me to seek professional help and acknowledged that I was not to blame for my struggles with anorexia.In theory, binge eating disorder and anorexia are similar; both conditions involve not listening to cues from your body, perhaps in attempt to gain control or manage emotional pain. However, my friends have been treated differently when disclosing their struggles with binge eating.Some of the same people who offer compassion and support to those grappling with anorexia may view binge eating as a character flaw that can be “fixed” with enough self-control and effort. My friends often felt as though as the empathy and understanding I received was nonexistent for them, as their disorders involved bingeing rather than restricting.This disparity has often discouraged friends from sharing their experiences. One friend observed her family rally around an aunt struggling with anorexia. When she shared her diagnosis of Binge Eating Disorder with those same people, however, she was shunned and humiliated. She watched as her family encouraged her aunt’s recovery process, while ignoring her experiences and progress. She finally found a therapist and dietitian who helped her with thoughts and behaviors she’s been plagued with for years — but she doesn’t have family with whom to share those successes.As I learned of my friends’ experiences, I was inspired to confront my own biases about health and appearance.When I shared my struggles with others, I was always sure to specify that I had been diagnosed with anorexia. People of all sizes and shapes can have anorexia, but most people attribute a specific thin “look” to the disorder. I feared that my size and shape did not match that stereotype or convey that I struggled with restricting, and I didn’t want people to assume that my behaviors involved bingeing. This fear highlighted my own internalized bias: I was open to be being perceived as someone with an eating disorder, but I didn’t want to be perceived as someone who binges.This perspective, I realized, did not match up with the support I gave my friends. I tell people I know who binge eat that I love and support them, and I note that their binge eating has no bearing on our relationship. I point out that they aren’t “wrong” for bingeing, that I don’t judge, that this is not a weakness of character. They are not at all defined by these characteristics — nor do they have to hide them and feel ashamed.So, I’ve come to realize that if I truly support my friends, and say that I don’t judge them, it is critical for me that I confront my internalized beliefs. As I strive to promote understanding and to reduce the stigma associated with eating disorders, I only mention my diagnosis if it’s relevant. If I say that I am recovering from an eating disorder and do not specify which one, people will realize that the points I share apply to anyone with an eating disorder, rather than just those who restrict.I invite you, too, to consider your beliefs as I continue to contemplate and address mine. Would you react differently to someone sharing their struggles with an eating disorder based on their diagnosis? Based on their size? Based on their habits?If so, why?Everyone deserves compassion and support as they live with and recover from eating disorders. This support requires a delicate balance of encouraging recovery-minded behaviors without passing judgment on the behaviors they may have now. I hope that by sharing our lived experiences and misguided judgments, we can start to shift the dialogue.Dr. Debbie Seacrest (they/them) is a math professor who works to identify and challenge their beliefs about themself and others.

      "body": "Psychosis can be otherworldly — and it can also be completely disturbing when the symptom becomes too intense. This disruption of thoughts and perceptions can be all-consuming, and your new reality often outpaces your understanding of and connection to the world. As a result, it can leave a person seeing, hearing and believing things that aren’t real. This is often accompanied by strange and persistent thoughts, behaviors and emotions.Those of us who have experienced psychosis (or cared for a loved one who has) know that this symptom of mental illness is difficult to navigate.Ultimately, psychosis is best managed with medication, therapy, support and education. If you are looking to better understand or manage this symptom, here’s what you’ll want to keep in mind.People experiencing psychosis often deal with a group of interrelated symptoms. Many people dealing with psychosis, often those whose symptoms are rooted in schizophrenia, are unaware that they have disconnected from reality. This lack of insight and self-awareness is called anosognosia. Others who experience psychosis are aware of their distance to reality and the distortions that complicate their connection to the world. Regardless, it can be challenging to recognize when something is “wrong” with your thinking.Delusions and other cognitive distortions can make it seem like these are natural changes in your mind’s perception. While there are rare cases in which psychosis stabilizes without professional help and medication, most people will find that their psychosis intensifies without medication and therapy. People generally need immediate psychiatric intervention to slow down and interrupt the cognitive distortions — so it is essential to talk to a professional if you notice this type of change.If your medical professional determines that you are experiencing psychosis, it will be important for you self-evaluate the impact of psychosis on your life and ability to function. When psychosis activates, different thought processes are interrupted and derailed. With the help of mental health professionals, you and your treatment team will learn how to identify each of these blocked and broken aspects of your thinking and cognitive functioning.There are methods you can practice to self-manage — or at least monitor — psychosis symptoms. After all, you won’t necessarily have constant access to a therapist or psychiatrist for counseling or support. Indeed, learning how to self-manage psychosis symptoms as best as possible without the help of a professional is vital to making gains in your recovery. Through ongoing mindfulness and self-reflection, you will be better prepared to self-manage active psychosis symptoms in your living environment.You can begin by paying closer attention to your patterns of interactions and habits on a moment-by-moment basis. Take notice of even the most minor changes or interruptions to any of these behaviors. Shifts in your behavior can indicate changes to your thinking and sometimes worsening psychosis.This kind of observation requires tapping into your external world. How do others evaluate your mental status? Checking in with friends, allies and peers is also an excellent litmus test for evaluating the quality of your thinking. If friends and family seem concerned or baffled by your speech or the quality of your thoughts, consider alerting your prescriber and therapist.This self-reflective process is difficult and may require changing your thinking, so pace yourself. If every detail seems important, that can signal an issue called “referential thinking.” If you find yourself zeroing in on every behavior, try taking notice of your patterns of thinking across your day or week instead.You’ll also want to ask yourself the following questions:The answers to these questions will begin to determine how to track the meaningfulness and effectiveness of your interactions.Despite your efforts to self-manage psychosis, you may experience a complete “break” with reality. In this case, you will still need to effectively communicate your situation and needs to those who can help you. This could involve alerting your family and the appropriate medical professionals (or your treatment team if you have one in place).In general, stress only further exacerbates symptoms, so the best time to communicate with your support network is when you can easily focus and articulate vital information related to your treatment.However, some situations may require you to communicate while symptomatic. For example, you may have to take antipsychotic medication to reduce symptoms, and when obtaining a prescription, you will need to speak with a pharmacist.Reflect on your experiences. Ask yourself questions about how you felt the task could have been completed differently or improved upon (or, perhaps, done with less distress). For example, when it was time to travel to the pharmacy, did you head there directly or make stops along the way? Given the distress you were experiencing, would it have been less risky to go directly to obtain your medication instead of putting it off until later in the day or month?How was your interaction with the pharmacist? Was getting your prescription a smooth and seamless process, or did the pharmacist express concerns about your behavior? Did they feel the need to intervene in your care, make comments on your behavior or have you removed the premises? Being familiar with the success of your past behavior and interactions will allow you to accomplish tasks with the least risk of harm.Ultimately, psychosis is a challenging symptom, one that you may have to manage throughout your life. Accordingly, those of us who experience it should always be practicing our “survival skills.” This begins with education and understanding how psychosis operates. It continues with determining how psychosis affects you — and what supports you’ll need in place.By developing a regular connection to medical professionals and peer support, you’ll be better prepared for the unexpected. Keeping safety as a goal and knowing your weak points during illness will improve your possibilities for navigating a break with reality and ensuring your safety.Max E.

      "body": "In August of 2018, I was recovering from my depressive episode earlier in the year when I got a request to review a book on my blog. The author had written about her experience with bipolar disorder and published her account, titled “Birth of a New Brain: Healing from Postpartum Bipolar Disorder.”As I read the book description, I thought my heart was going to stop. My hands were shaking and my breathing was rapid as I scanned the summary.In the book, the author discusses how she experienced the effects of a rare syndrome that some studies have linked to bipolar disorder called hypergraphia — the obsessive urge to write — after the birth of her second child. As I read her description of her symptoms, I saw myself, and my intense need to write after my third child was born in 2005.After learning of the symptom, I began to reevaluate my own behavior and my relationship with writing.Writing had been in my life long before I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in early 2006. But the drive to write my first novel had certainly come out of nowhere for me the year before my diagnosis. And the way I had been writing for my freelance career — turning in a story every single day for almost six years straight — sounded somewhat like this syndrome as well.I chewed on this insight for several days before calling my psychiatrist and setting up an appointment for the following week. Then I went to my husband, Bob, holding my breath.In the past, Bob had expressed that he felt I had an unhealthy relationship with writing — that it was an obsession and dangerous for me and my mental health. My writing became a point of contention, and in our final fight about the topic in 2012, he said to me, in exasperation, “I don’t care what you do anymore.”Since that fight, in the fall of 2015, I had enrolled in a brand-new Master of Fine Arts (MFA) writing program at the Mississippi University for Women. While Bob and I had discussed my potential enrollment beforehand (we both saw it as a way for me to possibly get a full-time teaching position at a university when I finished), I still avoided talking to him about my writing. I did not share anything about my classes or my continued attempts at publication, except when they were successful.I told Bob about hypergraphia and conceded that he might have been correct about my writing being a symptom of my mental health condition. I assured him I would be going to my doctor to get his thoughts on the discovery. I admitted that I could see when my writing could have qualified as hypergraphia, right after my youngest child’s birth. But I wasn’t prepared to say my entire writing career and passion had been hypergraphia as well. I asked Bob to hold off judgement, but to write a letter to my doctor detailing the symptoms he observed in me and what he felt.I went to my doctor, anxious about a potential diagnosis and armed with the letter that Bob had written him. The doctor kept the letter for his records and, after reading it, he agreed that perhaps some of my urge to write was a product of my bipolar disorder. He also recommended a medication that might aid me in differentiating the obsessive from the normal — a drug that would affect abnormal temporal lobe activity.I also brought my concerns to my counselor, Tillie. She was stunned at what I told her about hypergraphia and wondered how I even found out about such a condition.I told her the whole story and gave her a copy of Bob’s letter, and she suggested that Bob and I needed a joint session to work out what this discovery would mean for us.When we went to our joint counseling session in Tillie’s office, Bob seemed calm, much calmer than he had seemed at home.Tillie asked, “How often do you think Julie’s writing is a problem to her?”He said, “Maybe 20% of the time. It doesn’t happen often.”As he spoke, I wondered if, maybe, I could stop avoiding such an important topic from him. Maybe I could stop walking on eggshells and be open about my writing.Bob explained that he was not currently concerned about anything I was doing — news I was happy to hear. Tillie told us that this situation was just something we were going to have to address on a case-by-case basis. To communicate in a healthy way, I was going to have to hear Bob’s concerns when he had them, and I would not be able to shy away from conversations about it.Bob, she said, was going to have to understand that my writing wasn’t always a function of bipolar disorder; rather, it was my passion and career and often a healthy outlet. The key to making this work, we learned, was finding ways to avoid overthinking and exacerbating the issue; I would not overanalyze his concerns and he would not get overly vigilant in trying to detect “problems.”Ever since that talk, our worries about my writing have ebbed away slowly. My marriage had felt constraining, but now we feel free. It was a long road to repair our communication and trust, but we are still together and in love.Julie Whitehead lives and writes in Mississippi.

      "body": "Everyone experiences boredom at some point in their lives. Of course, we can all recall times when we were left without anything to do, when we weren’t interested in our surroundings or when we felt that our days were particularly dull. Feeling this way on occasion is perfectly normal.But sometimes, as I’ve seen in my work as a psychotherapist, chronic boredom can be a symptom of a deeper psychological issue that needs tending.My client, Rachel, grew up in a chaotic household. When I met her as a young adult, she didn’t seem to care much about anything, ending almost every sentence with “whatever” and rolling her eyes. This kind of behavior (that I refer to as an “I don’t care” defense) protected Rachel from emotional pain and discomfort. But it also disconnected her from the energy and vitality that being emotionally alive brings. Rachel was plagued by boredom, a feeling she described as “deadness.”My work with clients like Rachel has taught me that boredom can serve several protective functions — and that it can also damage our emotional well-being.Traumatic and adverse experiences during childhood, like being raised in a chaotic or emotionally neglectful household, can make a child feel unsafe. The lack of safety can trigger overwhelming and conflicting emotions, like rage and fear or sadness and despair. To cope alone, a child’s mind compartmentalizes “bad” feelings to carry on with life. While disconnecting from emotions spares them pain, it can also lead them to feel “deadened.”Boredom, in this case, is a byproduct of being out of touch with one’s core emotions of sadness, anger, fear, disgust, joy, excitement and sexual excitement. When we lose access to these core emotions, we cut off a vital source of energy that tells us what we like and don’t like.To move past this kind of boredom, we must learn how to safely re-connect with our vast emotional world. This involves tuning into our bodies, where emotions and their associated physical sensations live.Being in touch with our deepest wants and needs, especially when we believe they are unattainable, requires emotional vulnerability and puts us at risk for feeling pain. Here, boredom comes from disconnecting with our desires, wants and needs — for love, connection and positive regard from others, to name a few — and convincing yourself that you don’t want or need anything.Cutting ourselves off from what we truly want is an unconscious process designed to spare us the pain of not having our needs met. Healing requires taking ownership of restoring connections to our true wants and needs.The feeling of boredom might be telling us that we need to find new interests, people and hobbies in our lives. To overcome this kind of boredom, we must go through a process of self-discovery and trying out new activities.Overcoming boredom can be a complex task that requires us to build self-awareness and recognize our obstacles, like anxiety or an inability to focus. As you take on this process of self-discovery, it may help to reach out to a counsellor or coach for advice and support.To explore your relationship to boredom, try asking yourself the following questions:Boredom is a difficult state. But one doesn’t need to get stuck there. With a stance of curiosity and compassion, we can learn the roots of our boredom and make necessary changes.When our boredom tells us we need more interests, we can set a plan for trying out new experiences and practicing patience with ourselves until we find the proper balance of novelty and familiarity. If the boredom is a defense against anxiety, deeper emotions and needs, we can dig deeper to discover our buried feelings and desires.Then by honoring what we discover and working to process emotions (like shame, anger, sadness, disgust and fear), we can think through how to get deep needs met in safe and healthy ways. When needs can’t be met the way we want, like needing validation from another who is incapable, we need to feel that sadness so we can move beyond it. This is the route to reconnecting with our vital and most authentic self.To help my client, Rachel, we had to understand her boredom’s protective purpose. In Accelerated Experiential Dynamic Psychotherapy (AEDP), we invite patients to envision parts of themselves that hold distressing beliefs and emotions so we can process or transform them.I asked Rachel if she could imagine the part of herself that felt bored sitting on the sofa next to her. Rachel said she envisioned a 12-year-old girl dressed in goth clothing sitting on the sofa in my office.By whole-heartedly, and without judgment, welcoming parts of us that experience boredom, we learn by literally asking those parts what their protective purpose is and what they truly need. Almost always, core emotions from the past need naming, validating and to be felt in the body until they fully move through us. As a person recovers from past traumas and wounds by getting reacquainted with their deeper experiences (i.e., core emotions, wants, needs) defenses like boredom are no longer needed.Rachel’s vitality and zest for living emerged as she worked through her past traumas and eventually came to believe that she wasn’t to blame for her problems. She addressed the underlying anger she felt from her childhood pain and understood how “not caring” kept her safe from being hurt and disappointed by life. Ultimately, she learned as an adult, she was strong enough and supported enough to deal with life’s challenges and the emotions they triggered.Hilary Jacobs Hendel is a certified psychoanalyst and AEDP psychotherapist and supervisor.

      "body": "Thanks to sensationalized media depictions of mental illness and stigma surrounding mental health conditions, people tend to have a limited view of what depression actually looks like. When you think of a “depressed person,” perhaps you envision an image from a movie or medication commercial: Someone lying alone in a dark room, crying into a box of tissues, overcome with feelings of hopelessness.This picture is not necessarily inaccurate; it is simply incomplete. There are many more manifestations of depression — symptoms that aren’t necessarily visible or immediately obvious.Knowing the seldom discussed symptoms of depression is a valuable skill; being able to recognize the less obvious signs may help you or a loved one identify and seek treatment for depression, if needed. Additionally, knowing and fully understanding these symptoms allows us to be more compassionate and helpful to those who are living with mental health conditions.Here are a few lesser-known symptoms to look out for:Brain FogStudies have shown that depression can reduce cognitive functions, including working memory, long-term memory, decision making and ability to focus. Research also suggests that people with depression often have “widespread grey matter structural abnormalities” in the brain — observable structural differences that contribute to such cognitive deficits.This often presents in what we refer to as a “brain fog,” in which people may experience an inability to focus on tasks, slower reaction times, forgetfulness and feelings of being mentally “blocked.” Naturally, this can lead to a number of professional, personal and emotional challenges; combating cognitive symptoms can be a frustrating and demoralizing experience.If this is a symptom you have observed in yourself or someone else, remember to have patience; you and those around you are deserving of grace while navigating a health issue.Substance UseWhile substance use disorders are complex conditions, they are often linked to depression. People experiencing substance use challenges often face the consequences of misinformation and stigma; many are blamed for “poor choices” and irresponsibility.However, this misguided discourse fails to recognize many of the facets of addiction, including the fact that many people misuse drugs and alcohol to self-medicate their depression. They may not be aware that they are depressed, may not have the resources to treat their depression or may grapple with the stigma surrounding seeking help.We all have a role to play in dismantling stigma surrounding treatment for mental health conditions; if we can acknowledge that mental health is health, seek help ourselves and encourage others to follow suit, we may, in result, see a decline in substance use.Weight ChangesWhile weight changes can be indicative of a shift in physical health, they can also be connected to mental health. Depression is known to affect appetite; some people with depression experience increased appetite and report eating more, while others experience a decrease in appetite and undereat. Accordingly, large weight fluctuations may be a symptom of unmanaged depression.The challenge of coping with depression is often compounded by stigma surrounding weight and body size; one person may be “fat shamed” for their weight gain while another is praised for their weight loss, despite both weight changes being a result of mental illness. Overeating and undereating — and grappling with public opinion about bodies — only adds to the physical and emotional challenges of depression. A holistic approach to treating depression requires a degree of body positivity: An acceptance of all sizes with the goal of mind and body health.IrritabilityIrritability, anger and impatience often accompany depression. Perhaps you have experienced the surprise of these negative emotions that seemingly “come out of nowhere” — either when you experience them or are on the receiving end of an outburst from someone else.Often, these outbursts are referred to as anger attacks, sudden intense spells of anger could be considered uncharacteristic and inappropriate in the moment. In turn, this can lead to feelings of shame and confusion surrounding an inability to control these intense emotions. A 2009 study found that angry reactions in depressed individuals may stem from rejection, guilt, fear and “ineffective management of the experience and expression of anger.”While this experience can be distressing, sharing your concerns with a trusted health care professional could prevent further attacks.Extreme FatigueOften, the chemical imbalances that accompany depression can strip people of their energy. Individuals with depression often have low levels of norepinephrine, serotonin and dopamine. Without appropriate levels of these chemicals, we can experience fatigue, sleep issues, low motivation, decreased interest in once-enjoyed activities and a general lack of joy.For these reasons, many antidepressants work to increase these chemicals in the body.From the outside, these symptoms may be judged as a personal failing. Perhaps someone appears lazy, disorganized or unclean — but in reality, they are doing their very best to cope when they are struggling to simply get out of bed. In these moments, chores may go undone, hygiene may falter and basic tasks may get overlooked.Rather than passing judgment or demanding change, we need to remember that, often, compassion and medical intervention are the appropriate response.Physical PainOther possible physical manifestations of depression are vague aches and pains. The chemicals serotonin and norepinephrine don’t simply affect mood — they also influence how we feel pain. Accordingly, the chemical imbalance linked to depression is also linked to many types of physical pain.Additionally, research shows that there are biological factors that increase inflammation and decrease immunity during depressive episodes. Those with depression may experience headaches, body aches and stomach aches, among other ailments.Ultimately, it’s important to remember that depression is complex. It is a mental health condition that doesn’t always look like the tired trope we see played out in the media and stigma-laden conversations.Depression manifests in a wide variety of symptoms — both mental and physical — that most people may not be aware of. Of course, it is certainly possible to experience brain fog, misuse substances, battle fatigue and feel pain without having depression. But if you are noticing these behaviors and feelings in yourself or someone else, remain vigilant and consider seeking help. Prioritizing your health is not only wise; it is brave.Ginger Robertson is a registered nurse and mental health blogger.

      "body": "I always pause when someone asks the question: “Didn’t you always want to be a mother?”No. No, I did not.I have always liked children. My education and career have centered on children’s welfare and development. Never did I fear that children would “hold me back,” personally or professionally. I even enjoyed spending spare moments with kids.My hesitance about parenthood stemmed from my own childhood trauma and the state of my mental health. Specifically, I had two fears: That my mental illness would make me a terrible parent and that the genetic odds of my kids grappling with mental health conditions seemed too high.I live with bipolar disorder. Caring for myself — which includes regular therapy, medication, making space for grounding and re-centering myself — requires significant energy, intention and time. How could I expect to give a child or children the energy and attention they deserved? Even when healthy, I was plagued by thoughts of dread. When I was not healthy, my thoughts were downright terrifying.In adolescence and early adulthood, my manic episodes shed light on what I believed to be personal shortcomings that would prevent me from becoming a good parent. While manic and hypomanic (and amid delusions and feelings of grandiosity) I was not usually reflective, but in the moments when I was, I felt regret and shame over my self-centeredness. In those moments, I doubted I would ever be a suitable parent. Would I put them in danger, as I often put myself? Would my erratic behavior damage them?When I had depressive episodes, my thoughts about parenthood were filled with dread and gloom. What if I died by suicide and abandoned them? Even if I was physically present, would I be able to care for them? Getting out of bed, folding laundry, feeding myself and bathing felt unmanageable when I was depressed. If these acts were too much for me, how would I possibly meet the needs of a child? And how could I provide enriching experiences and joy to a home?Underlying these thoughts was deep self-doubt and the sense that I somehow didn’t deserve children.I have two beautiful, healthy children. What changed? In some ways, the shift felt abrupt. One day, I woke up and just wanted children, though I know that the journey required much more work and self-reflection than that.In the fall of 2008, I experienced a hypomanic, borderline manic episode. In my second year of graduate school, I found myself overcommitted and stretched thin: Too many courses, a 50-mile commute, training for a marathon, taking swim lessons, teaching, performing research and more. Autumn is always a precarious time for me.The rustle of leaves, vibrant colors, excitement about a new school year, cool wind whooshing in my hair — these typically beloved and highly-anticipated seasonal changes lead to a loss of grounding for me. And in the past, I would not even realize when I started to escalate toward mania.I distinctly remember the day my perspective began to change. It was the first cool day of the season, but I was still wearing shorts. As I walked across campus, mesmerized by the movement made by the wind on the ruffles on my shirt, a thought snapped into focus, “Oh, this could become mania. This could become very dangerous. I am already pushing myself too much.”I walked right into the campus counseling center. There, I started therapy, in what was the longest consecutive stretch of treatment I’d ever had. During this time, I received psychodynamic therapy to work through traumatic events from my youth and uncover how they fueled my fears about parenting. As I progressed, my self-doubt decreased and my capacity to imagine myself as a parent grew.I love my role as a parent, but parenting still terrifies me. Being a parent with a mental health condition terrifies me. Some of my earlier fears weren’t unfounded. A parent’s mental health condition presents the possibility for negative impacts on children. However, harm is not inevitable. In fact, I believe my history has made me a better parent.I practice vigilance when it comes to my symptoms, and I never take my health for granted. Diligently, I put routines in place that keep me healthy, and I model these behaviors for my children. For example, I have established evening routines that create conditions for healing and stabilizing sleep. Our whole family has now adopted them, too.Chances are, you haven’t heard other parents or caregivers talk about their struggles with mental health conditions. You may have heard about their children’s challenges with mental health, but not their own. If you are a parent or guardian, or considering parenthood or guardianship, and have a mental health condition, you are not alone. If 1 in 5 adults grapples with a mental health condition and roughly 40% of households have children under the age of 18, the math suggests that there are many of us.Parents and caregivers living with mental health conditions should be empowered to come out of the shadows. Doing so creates conditions for a supportive peer community and for parents to get the care we need to be the healthiest caregivers we can be.Nicole Beeman-Cadwallader works with a group of students with lived experience with mental illness as a part of a 4.0 Schools fellowship.

      "body": "I am in recovery from mental illness and have been on a positive path for the last few years. In the past, I have struggled with depression, anxiety, unresolved trauma, an eating disorder and, later, bipolar disorder.Recently, I have felt more balanced and stable with the help of regular therapy and appropriate medication. However, I still experience the effects of trauma and symptoms of C-PTSD. While the evolving discourse on mental health is shedding light on the impact of trauma, I have found that we don’t often discuss the experience of managing triggers in the workplace.1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experiences mental illness each year, so, inevitably, some employees will experience days where they need a moment to address their mental health and regroup. As we envision a healthier workplace that prioritizes mental health, it’s essential for employers to understand this potential for “bad” days and provide the necessary support and accommodations. Additionally, as individuals, we need to be aware of what our personal triggers are and what therapeutic coping skills work best for us.The workplace has changed drastically in the last two years due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Naturally, stress accompanies these changes — particularly in the health care field, as health centers are overwhelmed by an influx of patients.In my experience working in health care, daily tasks have doubled or tripled even though we have no additional help. This work is rewarding; I enjoy helping people and pride myself on doing my work swiftly and diligently. I’m proud of the way we go above and beyond to help. But this level of stress can also be a trigger to those who are managing their own mental illness and trauma.As we continue to navigate pandemic life and work, employers must remember that even those who enjoy their work can be triggered in the workplace and may need extra support.Despite my diligence in seeking help and managing my mental illness, there have been two occasions the last few months where my C-PTSD was triggered at work.The first instance took place when I was reconstituting a medication — a process in which we mix powdered medication and water — and I happened to be opening a medication that is notoriously difficult to work with. In these cases, we have been instructed to hit the bottle against our palms to better loosen the powder from its container. However, no matter how hard I shook the bottle or hit it against my palm, the powder remained stuck.Repeatedly hitting my palm, though done for a fairly normal reason, triggered me. But trauma does not necessarily recognize “normal” circumstances; while I was, in fact, safe, my body did not know this and reacted from past situations where I was unsafe.In the moment, I felt a deep, sinking feeling in my stomach and felt tears welling up in my eyes. I made an attempt to reset; out of sight of my colleagues, I took a minute to take a few deep breaths and repeated to myself, “I am safe.” Then, I jumped back into work, although I wish I had taken more time to myself. The distressing images in my mind gave rise to complex emotions, and I did not feel present.The second instance also took place during a routine task — directing an adult to administer a COVID test to a child — but I was particularly triggered by the circumstances. The child, who was understandably anxious about facing an unknown situation, was particularly vocal in expressing their distress. Upon hearing their protest and cries, I could feel a panic attack coming on. I quickly relocated to a back room where I could reset in private and allow my emotions to run their course.I calmed myself by focusing on posters hung up on the wall; I noticed the shapes, colors, text and designs. In this moment, I could feel myself dissociate. Everything goes numb — mind and body — and I sink into a floating world of nothingness.To ground myself and return from this dissociation, I practiced a technique called 5-5-5, which is a skill that engages the five senses. You name five things you see, four things you can touch, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste. This skill brings us back to the present, as we can feel very distant in the past in a flashback and no longer feel grounded. The time needed to reset in this way can vary person to person, but it’s important for me to get the feelings of panic out of my system — otherwise they can linger as I do my work.Employers can play a critical role in helping employees feel supported at work. As I was able to catch my breath and the tears and panic subsided during the second trigger, my phone vibrated in my pocket, snapping me back to present even more. My boss had texted me asking if I was ok. She then let me know to take a moment to myself and come back when I was ready.I appreciated the support from my manager, and I returned to work — but I still felt shame wash over me, as I worried that I had overreacted in the moment. However, with some reflection, I realized that I was not alone in managing complex emotions.One of my coworkers had gotten emotional a few months ago in a similar situation, and I had completely understood her reaction in the moment. Knowing that others feel deeply at times, too, helps me feel more comfortable expressing my own emotions.Now, reflecting on these incidents, I can acknowledge that I was skillful in the moment and recognized my needs. I am working through trauma and bravely recovering and accepting help. I am healing. And I can trust that my coworkers and I will support each other as we cope.I am continuing to make progress in my recovery and trauma work. Recently, I began eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR), a technique which has proven to have high success rates with trauma survivors. In fact, large percentages of patients report no longer experiencing symptoms of PTSD from a single event traumatic experiences after three 90-minute sessions.My hope is that I will continue to heal from doing work around my C-PTSD in therapy. I believe that healing is in the horizon, even though it means I must face the trauma before I overcome it.I hope that if you relate to my experiences, you can find ways to feel safe — at home and at work. Your pain is real. You deserve better. You deserve safety. And you deserve to be gentle with yourself and treated gently by others.Lexie Manion is a writer, artist, student and mental health advocate.

      "body": "While sitting in a waiting room at a doctor’s office in 2014, I struck up a conversation with the woman sitting next to me. As we got acquainted, she told me she was deeply involved with an organization called the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). I hadn’t heard of it, but I was intrigued because I was not a stranger to mental illness.My maternal grandmother experienced debilitating depression for years, culminating in her suicide in 1939. My mother was diagnosed with depression and experienced what I believe was PTSD, following her own mother’s suicide. I had grappled with mental health challenges myself, and I had been taking medication for depression and anxiety disorders for many years.As I learned about NAMI that day, I knew instinctively this was an organization to which I could happily devote my time and energy. I had always shied away from volunteerism because no cause had ever inspired the passion required to keep me motivated. Now, eight years later, I am still a NAMI member and vocal activist for mental health.With some personal reflection and review of scientific literature, I’ve come to understand that volunteering itself can be an act of self-care.Naturally, the dialogue surrounding activism and volunteerism centers on how others will benefit from volunteer work that you do. But years of research demonstrate that there are benefits for volunteers themselves. Whether you are a family member or caregiver for someone with a mental health condition — or have the lived experience yourself — volunteering can be a positive step toward improving your health and yield many benefits:In 2018, my long-time friend, psychologist Terri L. Lyon, hoped to create an easy-to-follow roadmap for people to identify the cause they are most passionate about (because focusing on one issue is more effective) and determine how to use the gifts they already possess to make a difference for that cause. With me as her editor, she published the book “What’s On Your Sign?” in which she introduced her unique “5-Step Activism Path.” The steps are:Perhaps these steps seem intimidating at first glance — but with reflection and time, they can lead to a meaningful new path. One example of following these steps is Knoxville jewelry artist, Christinea Beane. As someone with mental illness, Christinea makes jewelry for other people struggling with their mental health, to offer hope, raise awareness and remind them that they are not alone.As I address in the book I co-wrote with Dr. Lyon, “Make a Difference with Mental Health Activism,” we can’t underestimate the personal and wide-reaching impacts of volunteering and activism, particularly in the mental health field. Your work could not only boost your emotional well-being, it could also be a critical step toward ending stigma, achieving parity, and increasing mental health services and support. You can make a difference.Trish Lockard has been a volunteer for NAMI Tennessee since 2014. Mental health care became her personal passion following her family’s experience with mental illness.

      "body": "In a recent study in the American Psychiatric Association’s “Psychiatric Research & Clinical Practice,” lead and senior authors Christine Lu, M.Sc., Ph.D., and Stephen Soumerai, Sc.D., probed further into FDA public health advisories and “black box warnings” that were issued beginning in late 2003, 2005 and 2007. The advisories cautioned that children, adolescents and young adults taking antidepressants were at an increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior.The team produced the first long term study of suicide deaths following these warnings and their unintended effects. The Advocate spoke with Drs. Lu and Soumerai to learn more about the study: “Increases in Suicide Deaths Among Adolescents and Young Adults Following U.S. FDA Antidepressant Boxed Warnings and Declines in Depression Care.”Q: These “black box” warnings about the risks to youth and young adults persist today. Can you tell us how the FDA arrived at this conclusion and what the warnings were intended to do?A: The FDA issues warnings based on a variety of evidence about drug safety issues, from single case reports to randomized clinical trials.In this case, there were anecdotal reports that people taking Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants were more likely to have suicidal thoughts and behavior. However, the direction of causation is unclear: Youth taking antidepressants were almost certainly depressed in the first place, sometimes with suicidal thoughts.Meta-analyses of industry drug trials — which were the basis for the warnings — found a 1–2% increase in the number of young people experiencing suicidal thinking at the start of their antidepressant therapy. However, these meta-analyses were biased. The majority of the trials had neither clearly defined measures of suicidal thoughts, nor ways of accounting for the many people who dropped out of the study, which distorted the findings.The goal of the warnings was to alert clinicians to look for increased suicidal ideation early in treatment in individual patients. Unfortunately, the warnings stigmatized mental health care for young people. As mental health care declined, correspondingly, suicide attempts and suicide deaths increased in the U.S. population.Q: Tell us about your journey to study the results of these warnings. What inspired the research, and why have you stuck with it to this day?A: We realized we had data in the Health Care Systems Research Network (HCSRN) to rigorously address some important unanswered questions about the impacts of the antidepressant warnings. Depression is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide, and some psychotherapies and medications have proven successful in reducing symptoms.Only a few years after the warnings, several scientists began reporting that the warnings about antidepressants were causing unintended, large reductions in identification of depression, mental health visits and antidepressant use among youth, even among people with major depression for whom these represent first-line treatments. And these effects “spilled over” to adults and elderly people as well. At least three studies showed that the prior downward trend in youth suicide deaths may have reversed.However, the later studies only included one or two years (of observations) after the initial warnings, so these findings were only suggestive. So, we began work on a large NIMH-funded project to study the longer-term consequences of the warnings. We found that the warnings likely caused underuse of essential care, including substantial reductions in antidepressant use and increases in suicide attempts.Q: Tell us about your findings. Did they surprise you?A: No. We observed large increases in suicide deaths among adolescents and young adults following the widely publicized FDA antidepressant warnings and reductions in mental health care.The FDA antidepressant advisories, accompanied by media coverage, stigmatized depression care for young people and fostered reluctance by providers to initiate antidepressant treatment. Thus, these warnings reduced diagnoses of major depression, and drug and non-drug mental health treatment.Furthermore, 60–70% of adolescents and young adults with major depression do not receive any mental health care. While inappropriate use is certainly a concern, the major problem appears to be underuse, not overuse.This data supports a formal reevaluation of the harms and benefits of the antidepressant warnings. The risks of suicide deaths caused by untreated or undertreated major depression following the enactment of the FDA warnings are even more alarming than the risks of suicidal ideation that may be associated with specific antidepressant drugs. We recommend that the current boxed warnings, the FDA’s most severe warnings about a drug or drug class, be lifted entirely or “demoted” to the long list of routine warnings contained in product labeling.Q: What is unique about this study?A: This is the first long-term study to investigate whether suicide deaths in the U.S. increased among adolescents and young adults following the antidepressant warnings and the accompanying declines in depression diagnosis and treatment already demonstrated in large quasi-experimental studies.Q: Your study addresses the increase in suicide deaths, while other studies using the same methods have shown that the warnings caused outcomes that typically precede suicide. Can comparisons be drawn between these studies, especially in relation to the timing and shape of the effects of these studies?A: Yes. A number of strong interrupted time-series studies (led by Libby, Busch, and Gibbons, to name a few) showed that the warnings reduced diagnoses of major depression, and drug and non-drug mental health treatment; these are intermediate outcomes that predict suicide. This data adds to the evidence of an association between the antidepressant warnings and increased suicide deaths.The most striking intermediate outcome was the increase in suicide attempts demonstrated by our study in the BMJ in 2014. Our recent study mirrors and supports this earlier study of suicide attempts following the FDA warnings. The only difference is that we documented actual suicide deaths.Q: Are there implications of your study for policy advocacy at NAMI?A: To help support the needs of young people with depression, NAMI has an important role to increase awareness that individuals should adhere to psychotherapies and medication treatment as prescribed by their clinicians. We also strongly urge NAMI leadership to help support the FDA’s reevaluation of the antidepressant boxed warnings to convert these severe warnings to routine warnings. Strong data from different rigorous studies are now available to confirm that the existing boxed warnings are causing more harms than benefits, including reduced access to first line psychotherapy and medications, increases in suicide attempts, and increased suicide deaths.Stephen Soumerai is a professor of Population Medicine and founding and former director of the Division of Health Policy and Insurance Research, and he teaches research methods at Harvard Medical School.Christine Lu is an associate professor of Population Medicine and applies rigorous quasi-experimental research methods in her research.Note: This article was originally published in the Spring 2021 issue of the Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "If you live with depression, you’ve likely been advised to seek time in nature (just one of many activities proven to boost emotional well-being). As a professional fisherman of over two decades — and as someone who has encountered mental health challenges in the past — I have witnessed how fishing can improve mental health in a similar way. This activity, which has become my life’s work, can offer physical health benefits, provide tranquil space for reflection, teach resilience and build community.As I have navigated personal and professional successes and failures — and the resulting mental health implications — nothing has been more emotionally rewarding than fishing. I’ve found self-esteem in overcoming a challenging catch and support from meeting like-minded fisherman. I remember my first cast fondly, and I find comfort in recalling the sheer pleasure of handing myself over to nature while honing a new skill.While fishing is, perhaps, not the most obvious choice for a self-care activity, I want to share what it has given me.Studies show that physical activity, and the resulting improved physical health, has a direct, positive impact on mood and general well-being. You’ve likely heard stories about bikers, campers and various sports enthusiasts managing their mental health challenges through the activity they love. For me, fishing has delivered the same results.Before getting into the art of fishing, I spent my free time oversleeping and sitting in front of a screen — and I paid the price with my physical health. However, since I began fishing, I have abandoned old habits and traded screen time for a form of physical activity.Beyond offering a unique way to be physically active, fishing provides an opportunity to get outdoors and get in touch with your body. When I go fishing, I get the opportunity to clear my lungs and practice breathing exercises. At first, I was resistant to the idea that fishing could be meditative — especially when I would find myself wrangling a stubborn bass or sifting through buckets of tiny crabs. But I was wrong.Breathing in fresh air and observing freshwater allows me to center myself and recharge. In fact, when I’m feeling lethargic, a trip to the lake gives me the burst of energy I need.For me, fishing has become a critical part of my self-care to combat anxiety. When I cast a line and wait patiently for a bite, I am given a chance to practice mindfulness (a term I began hearing more amid the pandemic). Like many others, I have experienced my fair share of pandemic anxiety. Without opportunities to travel, my routine became stagnant, and I had fewer opportunities to be active. But fishing has consistently been a safe way to take time for myself — and it has reminded me of the importance of making deliberate choices for my well-being.Fishing has also allowed me to overcome profound losses due to COVID-19. I have lost close friends, many of whom were avid fisherman, to the pandemic, and I find that returning to the sport has given me opportunities to reconnect with them, even in solitude.Many of us who live with mental health conditions struggle with self-esteem and confidence. Perhaps we question our abilities and our self-worth and yearn for success or validation. Fishing, however, has given me a new perspective. When I began the sport, I wasn’t a natural — I made mistakes and often felt that I was “failing.” But practice and determination took me a long way. And I learned to enjoy the journey of mastering a new skill.Improving your self-image isn’t easy, but trying a new activity can be a great way to start. There are challenges in learning a new sport, and you aren’t always going to see success, but seeing yourself through the challenges and watching your own progress can be empowering.Consider fishing as a metaphor for overcoming your emotional struggles — there will be good days and bad ones, but success lies in pushing forward, one day and one skill at a time. Ultimately, one of my greatest takeaways from the sport is how emotional resilience puts you in charge of your growth.In my time as a professional fisherman, I’ve learned that that there is a strong connection between one’s interpersonal relationships and their emotional well-being. Engaging in a beloved activity (or trying a new activity) while connecting with someone makes the experience even more enriching and often provides a deep sense of belonging.Fishing can be a very social activity and provides it exciting opportunities to connect with and learn from a wide variety of people. I’ve met rookie and veteran fisherman from all walks of life — families, a woman recovering from breast cancer, a military veteran and backpackers traveling with their canine companions. I have developed friendships, and gained perspectives, I would not have found elsewhere. I’ve built a community, found support during tough times and I’ve even been given some incredible fish recipes.Ultimately, I’ve learned that fishing isn’t just another hobby — it’s an opportunity to tap into new skills, grow your self-confidence and find a support system. After 20 years, I say confidently that it has allowed me to grow mentally and emotionally. In the wake of a turbulent two years and a global pandemic, many of us need to take a step back from our everyday routines and reflect in a tranquil space with people we can trust.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I began my mental health journey 40 years ago, when I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder I. Outside of therapy and medical appointments, I had no one to talk to about what I was going through, so I began journaling as a means of self-expression and to let out my pent-up feelings.While writing was an important outlet, I truly found solace in listening to music. Listening to music could soothe me in a way nothing else could.The comfort I found in music is not surprising. Studies have shown that music in its various forms has therapeutic and medical value. The impact of music extends beyond the scientific literature; I have heard the stories of people whose emotional well-being has benefitted from formal music therapy — or even listening to a playlist of songs that they connect with mentally and emotionally.When I was struggling, alI I needed to do was put on an album or cassette (and eventually CD and mp3) and let the sound do its work. I wouldn’t just hear the music; I would feel it in my heart and soul. The melodies and rhythm of the songs I listened to combined to lift my mood and made me feel exuberant.As I developed coping mechanisms for my symptoms, I was able to gain a semblance of stability — and music remained a central part of my life. I even went on to work at my college radio station and a Buffalo-area reggae club, Rude Boys Roots Rock Café. Eventually, I graduated with a degree in broadcasting. After graduation, I got a job at a local recording studio.About four months after I began my new job, my life shifted drastically. I veered away from my treatment plan (I was drinking and using illicit drugs), and I faced the prospect of another hospitalization due to my non-compliance. I made the decision enter a 12-step program, which has been the single most important decision I’ve ever made for my recovery. I was able to find the stability I had always hoped for. This newfound balance allowed me to go back to school and pursue addiction counseling.Later in life, I re-entered the world of mental health advocacy and behavioral health treatment. I have focused my efforts in working as a Mental Health First Aid instructor. I have specialized in behavioral health education — and whenever I talk about self-care, I mention the power of music.As I have navigated life changes and mental health challenges, music has remained a constant. Twenty-seven years ago, I formed a small group of friends, and we began hosting what we called “Vinyl Night.” Together, we listened to records, shared stories of concerts we’d attended and recommended artists we loved. Vinyl Night has continued for decades, and it has become a support group for us, seeing us through births, deaths, life-threatening illnesses, job changes and moves.I have also channeled my love for music into social media. Last year, I began sharing songs on Facebook and telling my own stories about music. A friend suggested that I create a podcast. At first, I was intimidated by the work required, but I found a contact who could help with the details. When we spoke, he mentioned that he was interested in taking on a mental health-related project. From there, we were able to launch a podcast with the help of the Buffalo NPR station.On the podcast, I have conversations with my guests about the music that lifts their spirits — during difficult times and times of celebration. I’ve gone on to create a YouTube channel called “Mental Health Verses” to share more of this work.I’m still amazed by how much joy this project brings me. It has allowed me to engage with what I am most passionate about while also raising awareness about mental health.Karl Shallowhorn is the Director of Youth Programs for the Medical Health Association of Western New York and President and Founder of Shallowhorn Consulting, LLC.

      "body": "Last summer, I completed a 10-mile sponsored walk to raise money for the hospital that cared for me after my accident. By the end of the day, I realized I’d walked almost 16 miles.It was a remarkable achievement, given that nine months earlier, I couldn’t walk at all. I was crossing the street, a van hit me, and I ended up in the hospital with a fractured back.A week after the accident, I started experiencing distressing flashbacks. As I looked out of my hospital room window and saw the ambulances and traffic below me, memories of my own trauma resurfaced. After conversations with my care team that reassured me that professional intervention would be the option for me, I was ready to reach out for help. Six weeks later, I was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a mental health condition that can develop after a traumatic event.As I embarked on the long road to recovery, walking became the key to my physical and emotional well-being.After two days in the hospital, the doctors tried to get me moving. I was thrilled when I took my first few steps. Before my accident, I had been an “outdoorsy” and physically active person, so my limited mobility was an adjustment. During physiotherapy, I practiced walking with a frame and later with crutches.While the physical recovery was difficult, it served as a reminder about the importance of movement. Walking during my physical therapy sessions helped ease my lower back pain and gave me an activity to focus on during a time of uncertainty.While I slowly regained movement, I struggled with my mental and emotional recovery. While I was once an avid traveller, I suddenly found myself scared to leave the safety of the hospital ward. But I wanted my life back.After almost two weeks in the hospital, I returned home, light-headed from my medication. I managed to walk upstairs to my bedroom, but I spent a week there before I was able to walk back down. That’s when I knew I needed to get up and start moving to help my recovery.After my first short walk around our house, my walks became a regular activity. With my husband as my companion, I walked around slowly, still with crutches — and I started to be more observant. I began noticing my surroundings in a way I never had before. I admired the vibrant flowers and trees as we walked in parks and gardens. Once I no longer needed my crutches, we went for longer walks through the forest or on the beach. These outings gave me chance to truly stop and admire the beauty around me. It helped me to find joy in every day, in the simplest things around me.A few months into my recovery, I went for a short walk by myself. On my own, I noticed how dependent I had become on my husband since the accident; he had always been there when I needed emotional or physical support during my recovery. While I appreciated his care, I yearned for the independence I lost after my accident. I wanted to be able to trust myself again.So, I began taking solo walks in which I was fully responsible for my own well-being. This step assisted me in slowly restoring my independence, trust and sense of self.The mental progress I made during my walks shouldn’t come as a surprise; walking releases endorphins, chemicals in our brain that stimulate relaxation and improve our mood. Additionally, research shows that physical activities can help to reduce the severity of PTSD symptoms. And walking certainly achieves this for me.While high-intensity physical activities can cause shortness of breath and increased heart rate, which can be difficult for those of us living with PTSD symptoms, walking is an ideal form of movement. It’s exercise that you can tailor to your desired intensity level, whether you want a leisurely stroll or a power walk up a hill. It also promotes mindfulness, particularly if you are walking in nature.Walking helps me be present, to enjoy that moment of my life. As my thoughts start to wander, a sudden tooting of a car horn or the sound of the ambulance siren still triggers me to relive the trauma — but then I look for the beauty around me. I take deep breaths of fresh air and focus on my surroundings. I zero in on things I can see, hear or smell. Walking on the beach, I like to take my shoes off and walk barefoot and feel the sand on my feet. It helps me to intensify my senses and see again how beautiful this world can be. For a few minutes, I can forget about my fear or pain.Walking has also allowed me to slow my mind and ground myself. It helps me to keep my body, mind and spirit in a healthy balance. During my recovery, in the time of the pandemic, they were often the highlight of my day. Of course, on some days, it can be harder to bring myself to go for a walk, but I know that I’m doing it for my general well-being.Naturally, I can experience anxiety and remain super vigilant while crossing a road, but now I know how to handle the stress. I still have some way to go to get to where I was before the accident. However, I know that I’m walking in the right direction. After all, difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations. And I’m already thinking about my next walking challenge.Katy Parker is a mental health advocate and writer based in the UK.

      "body": "Robert, an adult in his 50s, had been processing the early emotional neglect and abuse that led to his low self-esteem and a decade-long episode of depression. Together, we had processed his rage, fear and disgust.With my therapeutic support and his courage, he worked his way through each emotion: Naming it, validating it, sensing it physically, and allowing it to flow up and out through his body. As the wave of each core emotion rose then fell, Robert experienced relief and newfound clarity.The most surprising part of this process for Robert, however, was the deep sadness that spontaneously emerged alongside relief, lightness and growing confidence. In accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy (AEDP), we call this phenomenon “mourning for the self.”Mourning for the self is healing in action. Fully feeling the core emotions that stemmed from his past traumas, Robert developed a profound understanding of how much he had suffered. With that acknowledgment came deep sadness for what he went through.Some people confuse mourning for the self with self-pity. Merriam-Webster defines self-pity as “a self-indulgent dwelling on one’s own sorrows or misfortunes.” That is not what mourning for the self is about. Self-pity stands in stark contrast to AEDP’s definition of mourning for the self which is “a painful but liberating experience of compassion for the self.”Processing core emotions the way we do in AEDP requires a compassionate stance toward ourselves — a stance that many people have difficulty finding. When I first met Robert, he grappled with disdain for his inner child. When I coached him to approach himself with radical compassion and acceptance, he said things like “I hate that part of me for being weak, and I blame myself. I should have been able to escape.”I asked him, “Would you ever blame your son if a teacher or relative mistreated him?”He retorted with an emphatic, “No!”“Why not?” I asked.“Because he is innocent and just a helpless child. He deserves to be seen, loved and treated kindly.”“Exactly,” I said, “You know how to be a good parent. Can you turn all that love and compassion inward to the little boy you once were?”And then, an epiphany. He got it.Mourning for the self is about not only understanding what we have been through but actually feeling those experiences for ourselves.The consequences of unresolved traumas are huge. For many of us, years of our lives may have been compromised by false beliefs that we were not good enough or worthy of being loved. Beliefs that others could not possibly accept us for our true selves, flaws and all, can lead to loneliness and a feeling of disconnection. For many of us, unsatisfying relationships may have been the norm because we lacked trust in others. Some of us never had the pleasure of being in our bodies, feeling vital and authentic.I love being an AEDP therapist because I see it as a healing model with predictable results. Over and over again, I have witnessed my patients process emotions and heal from their traumas. They recover their true selves. A key part of this process involves acknowledging losses and mourning.Tears poured down Robert’s face as one hand covered his eyes in embarrassment. “I hate crying,” he said. Feeling deep love and admiration for this man, I gently whispered, “Your sadness is beautiful. It comes from your strength. This is your love... for yourself... and it’s good to let it come.”Hilary Jacobs Hendel is author of the international award-winning book, “It’s Not Always Depression: Working the Change Triangle to Listen to the Body, Discover Core Emotions, and Connect to Your Authentic Self” (Random House).

      "body": "Acceptance.In one word, that is how I cope with mental illness and the emotional journey to find effective treatment.Accepting the reality of my mental health has taken time. It all began in 2008 when, within months of giving birth to my first baby, I was diagnosed with severe postpartum depression. During what I thought would be the happiest time of my life, depression robbed me of the joys of life with a new baby and the simple pleasures of life in general. Despite medications and therapy, it took me over a year to recover from the episode — time that I can never get back.Unfortunately, that year was just the beginning of my struggles with mental illness.Suffering from postpartum depression had been such a harrowing experience that I was very apprehensive about having another baby. But in 2013, I gave birth to another beautiful baby girl. Again, the monster that is depression attacked. This time, I gave up breastfeeding early in hopes that my hormones would balance themselves out sooner and the depression would subside.Again, I went through the maze of trying to find the right medication regimen and therapist. But just like the first time, it took over a year to find balance — a long time to wait when every minute is a struggle. But eventually, the fog cleared, and I got my smile back. That’s the thing about recovery: My smile was brighter because I was so thankful to be on the other side of depression. I found strength in having overcome.I thought that with the end of having babies came the end of suffering from mental illness, but in 2016, I found myself wrapped up in a full-fledged manic episode. I was going through a rough time at my corporate job, having issues with my boss and trying to juggle work with family life.Before long, I started to lose sleep over these challenges, and after a few sleepless nights, I began behaving so erratically that I ended up at an acute psychiatric clinic. I remained there for almost two weeks, surrounded by nurses and strangers, away from my kids. Thankfully, however, I received the treatment I needed. Shortly after, I made changes in my professional life until I no longer had work stress to deal with. I decided to become a stay-at-home mom, hoping that would improve my mental health.After addressing the issues in my professional life, I thought I was in the clear — and that the mania was a fluke due to an unprecedented amount of stress. However, another period of depression (which, I learned, usually follows mania) set in. By this time, I had no faith in any medication, but I still tried to find something that might work; anything to ease the pain.I also continued to see my therapist, but relief felt unattainable. I tried all the common recommendations, but no amount of clean eating, exercising, strolling through the park or getting sunlight did the trick. As with the first two bouts of depression, it was over a year before the sun finally began to peek through the clouds.All was well for some time, until 2020 rolled around, and I decided to pursue creative ambitions. I signed up for a writing workshop and became so enthralled in the delight of the work that I began to stay up late, night after night, sometimes until 5 a.m. Before I knew it, I was once again spiraling rapidly in a manic tornado that spit me out into another psychiatric care facility.As with my previous hospital stay, I got the care and medication I needed to control the mania. Again, the mania was once again followed by depression — and this is a cycle that I am still battling to this day. But rather than fearing what’s next, I face the future with continued therapy, medication and hope that my struggles will subside as they have in the past.I now accept that I suffer from mental illness. I accept the good times and the bad, the past and the present, and the uncertainty of what my future looks like. I recognize that resisting the reality of my situation was part of the problem. I also recognize my red flags for heading into mania (loss of sleep, mind racing uncontrollably and rapid speech) and depression (low energy and loss of interest in everyday life).I could go back and count all the years that I lost to depression, but what would that do aside from rob me of more time? I could dwell on all the hurtful words and insults I hurled at family and friends while in a manic state, but I’ve apologized as much as I can, as well as recognized that these reactions were often beyond my control.One step to arriving at self-acceptance was reading through the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). It was sobering to see so many of my behaviors plainly listed in the manual and learning about the disorder within that context. I wish someone would have handed me the DSM-5 for my review when I was having a hard time accepting my diagnosis from my medical team. I probably would have arrived at self-acceptance sooner.There might not be a perfect cure for my mental illness, but each time I’ve grappled with it, I’ve found an effective treatment and not only survived, I’ve come out stronger and wiser. I may not be able to control whether I’ve passed those genes on to my daughters, but what I do know is that I will be here as a resource for them, and for anyone else who could benefit from my experiences. For that, I am grateful.Bianca Valentin is a mom and wife.

      "body": "Simply put, I’ve been through some stuff. I’ve faced childhood trauma, the sudden loss of a parent and a lifelong battle with bipolar disorder. Through these challenges, writing about my experience has helped me cope. It kept me grounded when I felt like the world was upside-down. Instead of bottling up emotions, I’ve logged them, which has been cathartic and freeing. In addition to treatment and self-care, journaling has helped me navigate through the toughest times.My dad struggled with bipolar disorder. He was often depressed and distant. While he lived in the same house with me and my mom, he was never truly present. He’d lock himself in his bedroom for days, then explode in angry outbursts. I was left confused, wounded and yearning for his affection. I felt unloved. Trying to make sense of my dad’s volatility, I often blamed myself. I thought if I could just be the perfect daughter, then he’d love me. I felt broken and needy.I would go on to suffer from unexplainable mood swings of my own. I was frenetic and unbalanced. My mind would race a mile a minute. I jumped between jobs, apartments, relationships and even sexual identities. By the time I was in my twenties, I was delusional and hearing voices.In 1998, when I was 24, my dad lost his battle with bipolar disorder and died by suicide. I felt abandoned. His death triggered my first major depressive episode, and I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder as well. My heart sank. There was no denying it: I had the same mental illness that took my dad from me. A bipolar diagnosis suddenly felt like a death sentence.With the help of my mom (who’s a psychotherapist) and my treatment team, I learned as much as I could about bipolar disorder. I read self-help books voraciously, educating myself on mania and depression. My therapist suggested I write down my thoughts and feelings, so I started journaling. I released my fear, frustration, anger and sadness until my hand hurt from writing. I filled six notebooks with stories from my life, and I began seeing them with new eyes. I recognized many of my dad’s (and my own) behaviors as symptoms of bipolar disorder.Eventually, I came to terms with my diagnosis, which helped me understand my dad for the first time. We had the same mood disorder but with different faces. My bipolar disorder made me hyperactive and reckless. My dad’s illness made him disconnected and sullen. When I realized how powerful and consuming mental illness could be, I understood that my dad’s erratic hostility was no more his fault than it was mine. My writing journey helped me forgive my dad for all the times he’d hurt me.I moved on with my life, convinced I was “fixed.” I put my journals away, assuming I no longer needed them. However, despite all my newfound insight, I hadn’t fully addressed my “daddy issues” from childhood. Once I stopped writing, I forgot to listen to my inner voice. I lost touch with myself, and because of that I kept choosing the wrong men as romantic partners.When I was 35, I met a guy who paid more attention to me than any man ever had. In the beginning of our relationship, he doted on me. I’d never felt so special. Because I desperately needed validation from men, I failed to notice that he was also becoming controlling as time went on. But by then it was too late; I was hooked. And I married him.By the time I was 38, my marriage had become downright abusive. I spiraled down into a severe bipolar depression and attempted to end my own life. Luckily, I survived. I was admitted to an inpatient mental institution and, once discharged, I promised myself I’d never go back. I’d made the same mistake my dad had, but I had a second chance at life. I vowed not to squander it.I bought new notebooks and started journaling again. I felt like I was reconnecting with an old friend who I hadn’t seen in ages. I poured out feelings of worthlessness, examining my sense of self and my daddy issues. Writing helped me finally face my demons. I began a journey of recovery by finally coming to terms with who I was and reconciling it with who I wanted to become.Writing my story down helped me confront the trauma I’d endured. My past was a learning experience that made me resilient. Journaling gave me the strength to leave my husband and put myself back together. I emerged from a long, dark tunnel that seemed at times to have no light at the end.Over the years, I kept writing. Originally, it was purely therapeutic — not meant for anyone but me to read. But one day, I realized that my story might inspire hope for others who were struggling like I had. By 2018, I’d written so much that I had a book on my hands. I’d turned the pain of my past into a huge accomplishment I could be proud of. “Daddy Issues: A Memoir” was published in 2021.Carrie Cantwell dedicates herself to mental health advocacy and suicide prevention.

      "body": "It was November, just after I had been discharged from my fourth inpatient stay that year. I was depressed, anxious and unsure if I could finish out freshman year at my university. I had moved home so I could focus on recovery without the stress of living in an on-campus dorm.My mom, desperate to find something to help me engage with the world, brought me to the local animal shelter. Immediately, I was overwhelmed by the number of animals with their faces pressed against the bars of the cages. My eyes fell on a young Siamese cat with a striped face and tail. She cowered at the back of the cage. A shelter volunteer told us that she had been there for six months, ever since she was found trapped in a wall as a kitten.I reached my hand into the cage. She tentatively rubbed her head against my hand before flinching and retreating to her hiding spot. The volunteer told me that she would need a lot of work if we were to adopt her, and she was unsure if the cat would ever come around to being a tame house cat. I signed the adoption papers a few minutes later and brought her home. Little did I know how impactful she would be on my recovery.The new medication I was taking often sedated me, so I slept for most of the next few days. When I was awake, I spent most of my time bonding with my new cat, whom I named Maya. She stayed hidden underneath the bed I bought for her, never coming out to eat or drink. I brought out my favorite book, “Pride and Prejudice,” and began reading it out loud so she would get used to my voice.By the second day after adopting Maya, she took a few steps toward me with trepidation. I held a treat in my hand and watched as she took it from my fingers. I took a few deep breaths, calming my anxiety that rushed through me. I had to be calm for Maya.After a few days of reading to Maya and feeding her out of my hand, she seemed to open up to me. She let me pet her, as long as I let her approach me first. Having an animal that I was responsible for gave me a reason to get up in the mornings. I had to clean her litter box, feed her and play with her. I couldn’t just retreat into my thoughts and refuse to interact with the world like my depression wanted me to. Maya needed me as much as I needed her.After the week was over, I returned to my online classes for the first time since returning from the hospital. I did all my classes in my room with Maya, continuing to let her acclimate to my presence. One day during class, she climbed into my lap and settled down to sleep. I felt my first positive emotion in a long time that day. I even allowed a small smile to creep onto my face.Maya became popular in my online group therapy sessions where she would beg to play fetch by bringing me a toy mouse to throw as if she was showing off for a crowd. She started sleeping on my bed every night and would follow me around the house during the day.I started to see small improvements in my mental health after I adopted Maya. I had days where I was able to get out of bed and get dressed. Having an animal that was completely reliant on me calmed the intrusive suicidal thoughts I had been struggling with for the past year. Having a soft cat that was nearly always on my lap helped to soothe my anxious mind and gave me a companion to help me through my hardest days.I chose to withdraw from my university in the spring semester and take a couple months to focus on my recovery. The following months were difficult, as I underwent medication changes and treatments to focus on healing. Maya was by my side as I suffered through medication withdrawal and while I adjusted to the new medications. She was there when I came home exhausted from my daily transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions.As spring turned into summer, I started seeing bigger improvements. I had more days where I was able to be myself and laugh, and I chose to interact with the world more. When my family went on vacation that summer, we brought Maya with us. I was able to enjoy myself for the first time in several years, and when I felt overwhelmed, I could always go to my room and find Maya, who would instantly climb onto my lap and settle in. Together, we could help each other.At the end of the summer, I chose to enroll again in university. I felt that, with intensive support, I was ready to return to my education. Finding recovery took a good medication regimen, the right kind of therapy and an arsenal of coping skills, but in the end, it also took the unconditional love of a little Siamese cat named Maya.Anna Smith is a sophomore at Virginia Tech studying communication with a minor in psychology.

      "body": "A trigger, sometimes referred to as a stressor, is an action or situation that can lead to an adverse emotional reaction. In the context of mental illness, referring to triggers usually means something that has brought on or worsened symptoms.In the ongoing dialogue about mental health, we don’t talk enough about triggers. Most often, the discussion focuses on what happens after a person has been triggered, which is when the situation is much harder to address. Understanding, identifying and working to prevent triggers can be more empowering and effective.Triggers are individualized experiences that vary widely from person-to-person. For example, a trigger may elicit a physical reaction, such as heavy breathing or sweating. A trigger can also spur an emotional reaction, like thinking “I am being attacked, blamed, controlled, disrespected, hurt and judged.” After experiencing a trigger, a person may feel overwhelmed, powerless, scared, unloved and weak, among many other feelings. These feelings can be very difficult to address and quite detrimental to mental health.A person’s behaviors based on their emotional reaction can range from relatively minimal to serious, such as acts of violence. Someone exposed to a trigger while symptomatic may be more vulnerable and the emotional reaction may be stronger. Additionally, a trigger can impair judgment and some people may lack insight about their reactions.It is important not to assume that you understand the emotional response of someone who has been triggered or suggest that someone who has been triggered is overreacting, being “too sensitive” or being irrational, even if the trigger may seem insignificant.Many different stimuli can be possible triggers, and they are often strongly influenced by past experiences. Personally, as someone who lives with mental illness, I have experienced numerous triggers when I’ve been symptomatic. These triggers have led to extreme discomfort, family conflict, onset of illness, worsening of symptoms, episodes and hospitalizations.External triggers: In the summer of 2006, I became engrossed watching the inexplicable war and tragic loss of life in the middle east on CNN. This triggered a severe psychotic manic episode. Similar geopolitical events triggered me twice more. Each time I was hospitalized. To prevent this trigger from repeating, I stopped watching televised news.Internal triggers: I was triggered by feelings of abandonment when my spouse avoided contact with me to minimize conflicts. I would at times spontaneously angrily erupt. To address these feelings, I talked to my spouse and let him know how our strained communications made me feel, and he reassured me that he had no plans to leave me.Trauma triggers: I live near the hospital where I experienced a traumatic hospitalization. It was along a convenient route for me to access public transportation, but every time I walked by it, I recalled that hospitalization and was “re-traumatized.” After being triggered several times, I decided no longer to walk past the hospital and took a longer, alternative route.Symptom triggers: A lack of or reduced need for sleep has occasionally triggered the symptoms of my bipolar disorder. In this situation, I quickly address any sleep disruption, often with a medication adjustment in consultation with my doctor.There are many possible coping strategies. Strategies should seek to eliminate, avoid and reduce the impact of triggers and emotional reactions. Each person must identify what works best for them through trial and error. Different coping strategies may work for different triggers and emotions.Learn to identify: Consider reactions to past triggers; who or what was involved, where, when and why it took place. Observe patterns and obvious signs of risk to prevent a similar situation (like ceasing to watch televised news).Make a plan to address: Create a plan to address triggers and emotional reactions. You may want to talk to loved ones or your treatment team to let them know how they can best help you when you are triggered. Be sure to carefully address triggers that occur repeatedly, because each time they do, the emotional reaction may be greater.Try problem-focused coping: Confront your stressor directly or try to find a solution to the stressor. For example, driving your kids to school may cause you to worry, because you’re afraid you might arrive late to work. Instead, you can ask someone else to drive your kids to school.Try emotion-focused coping: When you cannot eliminate or avoid a trigger, focus on regulating your reaction to a stressor which may help reduce the stressor’s impact. For example, meditation can help reduce stress, anxiety and depression.Communicate if someone is triggering you: A person triggering another person often does so unintentionally. Talk to them about their actions and their impact to clear up any misunderstandings and consider possible solutions. Have an open, calm and understanding dialog. Be willing to work with them. If the person who is triggering you refuses to act sensitively, it may be best to set clear boundaries.Find the right therapy: Specific types of therapy have been shown effective in addressing triggers. Specific therapies especially helpful for addressing trauma triggers include exposure therapy and EMDR therapy.Reality-check your thoughts: To minimize the escalation of thoughts and feelings, it may be helpful to “reality check” thoughts to assess their reasonableness. A few ways to do this include:Look for trigger warnings: Triggers warnings can help alert you to triggering material, especially materials related to suicide or violence. Sometimes, an article will provide a trigger warning at the start of the piece. You can even ask others to provide you with a trigger warning about materials they share.Practice self-care: Prioritizing your mental health can help build resilience against potential triggers. You can start by talking to someone, such as a loved one, friend or therapist. You may also want to practice mindfulness, meditation, deep breathing or journaling.It’s difficult to control our triggers; however, we can learn from our experiences. We can apply what we learn to manage and limit the risk of being re-triggered. We can’t diminish or dismiss the trigger or only focus on what happens after we’re triggered — we must also focus on what we can do beforehand.Each time we’re triggered is a learning opportunity that can help us manage our reactions in the future. If we can’t control the trigger fully, we may be able to limit the emotional reaction to it before it becomes problematic and harder to address. We might even be able to prevent the trigger by preparing for it. We can have some control, and anything that gives us a little control over our mental illness can help keep us well.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

How do organizations create a workplace that supports the mental health of their employees during another transition?Much like assembling the pieces of a puzzle, organizations are piecing together a “new normal” — and the ones that do it well will bring a mental health perspective to the conversation. This will go a long way toward retaining employees while keeping productivity and innovation high.So, what does “bringing a mental health perspective” look like?Each company and employee are unique, as are their needs and demands. If we have learned anything the past year and a half, it has been the need for a flexible approach to work, heightened emotional intelligence and resilience. Companies that lead with this, while centering the mental health of their employees, will come out ahead.Prior to the pandemic, many believed that productivity and performance were dependent on being in the office, with points given for partaking in activities that provided visibility and the opportunity to be seen Things like actual “face time,” networking and an emphasis on building strategic work relationships.After transitioning to working from home, we learned that productivity and performance didn’t suffer — and in many cases, it flourished. That’s a benefit that companies can continue to make use of. However, one challenge remains; lines have become blurred as employees answer emails after hours, on weekends and even in the middle of the night. Boundaries have become unclear (and sometimes even disregarded) as the sense of “always being on the clock” has become the new norm.Regardless of the stressors and even isolation that many reported due to working from home, employees enjoyed the increased flexibility and independence. Fast-forward to today, and many have finally found ways to make the unexpected change work, and are more than a little reluctant to let it go, which seems to be feeding the current exodus from the workforce.All these factors impact the mental health of employees who don’t want flexibility just for flexibility’s sake. They want it to avoid the all-too-familiar stress, burnout and overwhelm of outdated productivity and performance metrics. Organizations that understand this landscape can create environments that empower their employees and teams by prioritizing mental health.Organizations should create an environment that incorporates employee needs and engages feedback. Companies that survey their employees are better positioned to create a workplace solution that fits their employees’ needs as well as their own. Command and control are a thing of the past; if companies want to retain employees and engage productivity and innovation while avoiding burnout, they will need to take an open and exploratory approach to reinventing the workplace.Here are some ideas companies should keep in mind to create not just a new normal, but a better one.Companies that engage their employees in creating a new workplace that centers on mental health gain more than productivity. They foster highly connected employees who are committed to being flexible, not only for their own personal needs, but for the needs of their teams and the company as a whole. They build leaders who are skillful in imparting empathy and understanding to support the needs of their team, recognizing that each employee has different needs, just as they have different talents and attributes.Throughout this process of engagement, feedback and flexibility, companies demonstrate their values in tangible ways, thus creating a workplace responsive to the needs of the environment and the people who inhabit it. This will allow the “new normal” to be translated into strong and effective workplace practices, which increases employee retention and supports ongoing productivity and innovation. These are the outcomes where mental health thrives — in this new normal and the next one to come.Wema Hoover is an executive and a culture, diversity, equity and inclusion practitioner.

      "body": "With most state legislatures convening in January, now is the perfect time to start getting ready to put mental health on the legislative agenda.Together, let’s make mental health a priority issue — from your local city council to the halls of Congress.NAMI cares about many policies, especially ones that ensure people get help early, get the best possible care and get diverted from justice system involvement. What policy issues are important in your community? Check with your local NAMI office to see what they’re working on locally.One issue that you can always advocate for is budget funding for mental health services and supports. Budgets reflect community values and constituent needs. As an advocate, you can raise your voice to urge elected officials to invest resources in mental health care.Many elected officials at the local, state and national levels play a role in allocating budget funding for mental health services and supports. Direct your advocacy toward these decision-makers to ask them to prioritize mental health funding.Nationally, members of Congress and the president are responsible for federal funding decisions. These include funding for community services through the Community Mental Health Block Grant, veterans’ mental health care through the Department of Veterans Affairs, innovative research at the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), housing assistance through the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and community policing and diversion initiatives through the Department of Justice. The federal government also funds mental health care through Medicare and Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI).At the state level, state legislators and governors decide on funding for community-based mental health services and supports, as well as funding for longer-term care and state-run psychiatric hospitals. If you’re looking to advocate for First Episode Psychosis programs or crisis services funding, direct your advocacy toward state legislators and governors.Local officials like mayors, council members or county commissioners also make funding decisions for community-based mental health services and supports in their communities, especially if your local government provides care directly.Being an advocate means speaking up for the change you wish to see. This can be accomplished by calling, emailing, tweeting, attending a town hall or sitting down and meeting with an elected official or their staff. If you want your policymaker to focus on mental health, you can:Communicating with elected officials can seem a little scary. But with the right tools, you will be advocating in no time! Talking points are a great tool to help support your argument. You can use talking points with elected officials as a place to start your conversations in person, through email or on the phone. If you’re comfortable, add a brief personal story — no more than 90 seconds — about how mental health impacts you and how funding mental health services and supports will help you and your community.Here’s some sample language to help you advocate for mental health funding:Fortunately, there are more ways to communicate with elected officials than email, phone and in-person. Now, elected officials are interacting with constituents on social media. You can find your elected officials’ social media accounts by going to nami.quorum.us/officials.Want to engage your elected officials on social media? You can post the sample message below on their Facebook pages or @ them on Twitter or Instagram.

      "body": "I’ll admit that the first time I entered the room, I was really, really scared.It was my first time in a mental health support group. I felt uneasy, thinking about telling my family’s story to people I’d never met before. What if they judged me? How would I react if there was a long, uncomfortable silence after I’d shared a painful truth?As it turns out, I didn’t have to worry. The people sitting around the table were friendly and welcoming. They reassured me that I didn’t have to say a thing, especially that first time. I could just listen, take it all in and decide when I was ready to take part.This group had been created especially for people like me — people who were providing care for someone with a mental health condition. They had created thoughtful guidelines that made me feel more comfortable. For example, members pledged to protect each other’s confidentiality. They agreed to “share the air” so that no one person would monopolize the group’s time. The people guiding the conversation were peers, which meant they’d faced many of the same struggles I was bringing into the room.It took time, but before long, my weekly support group became the place I felt safe releasing the pain behind my experiences. There was no need to hide because no one was there to shame or criticize. We all wanted and needed the same things — compassion, support and suggestions for coping with the difficulties of supporting someone with mental illness.Unlike talk therapy, a support group offers you the chance to explore your thoughts and experiences with others who are going through similar challenges. While some groups are led by mental health professionals, many (like mine) are organized and run by peers. This gives people the chance to form a unique circle of caring that offers connection, comfort and perspective.Here are five unique benefits I gain from attending a free, drop-in support group each week (or as often as I can make it):Mental health support groups can be found in most communities. There are also hundreds of online groups. In fact, my group has been getting together on Zoom since the pandemic began, and we’ve found that in some ways, meeting virtually works even better for us.Groups are hosted by mental health organizations, hospitals, clinics and community groups. Some are fully independent and run by group members. You can also explore the support groups offered by local NAMI affiliates.Nearly eight years after that first anxious night, I see my support group as a true lifeline. Spending time with these thoughtful, caring people restores my balance, especially when worries about my loved one loom large. And for many of us who struggle with our own mental health conditions, the relief our weekly group provides is a double blessing.Though you might feel reluctant at first, I encourage you to give your local support group a try.Betsey O’Brien is an independent writer focused on mental health and its impact on individuals, families and communities.

      "body": "Our team at NAMI remains focused on access to the best care, so we’re sharing information on changes to how the medication, clozapine, is prescribed and dispensed.Clozapine is an effective medication, and the only one that is Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Clozapine also reduces the risk of suicide for people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. It’s an important tool for treatment, and individuals who take clozapine report significant improvements in their symptoms. This means a lower need for hospitalization, and a meaningful improvement in quality of life.Clozapine offers many benefits, but as with any medication, there are potential risks. One of those risks is a rare side effect of a loss of white blood cells, which are vital in helping the body fight infection. Prescribers and pharmacists monitor this risk using a system called the Clozapine REMS Program, and this system is now undergoing a major change which could affect those who take this medication.The goal of this change is to simplify the reporting system for prescribers and, in turn, make it easier for pharmacists to dispense the medication.NAMI invited our colleagues from SMI Adviser, an initiative funded by SAMHSA and administered by the American Psychiatric Association, to share the latest information regarding this change. We thank them for their collaborative efforts to help prescribers and pharmacists adjust to the new system and avoid disruption in treatment for those who rely on clozapine to manage their mental health condition.From SMI Adviser:Any hiccups in access to medication can create serious issues for patient care. That’s why we created a new guide that helps prescribers and pharmacists navigate recent changes to the Clozapine REMS Program. We also created a guide for individuals and families who may be impacted by the system updates. These guides are a collaboration between NAMI and SMI Adviser, a national program funded by SAMHSA and administered by the American Psychiatric Association.The goal of the Clozapine REMS Program is simple. It helps make sure that the benefits of taking this medication outweigh the risks for each person who takes it. And since 2015, the system has worked to fulfill that purpose. However, in July 2021, the FDA approved changes to the system. The changes went into effect on Nov. 15, 2021.These changes require action from anyone who prescribes or dispenses clozapine. You must take a series of steps on behalf of yourself and any patients in your care who are on clozapine.We strongly urge you to access the new guide, which provides detailed guidance on what you need to do in order to:If you have questions, that’s okay. SMI Adviser offers other resources that you may find helpful as you process these changes. You can access these free resources at any time:After reading the guide for individuals and families, those who include clozapine in their treatment plan may have additional questions. We encourage you to talk to your prescriber, as well as your pharmacy, to help reduce the potential for interruption in treatment. Communication with your treatment team is always a key part of self-care, and this is an important opportunity to build on it.We hope that you find this information useful. It’s critical to ensure access to this lifesaving medication for those who need it.Ken Duckworth, M.D., is NAMI’s Chief Medical Officer.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "When things got bad, everyone told me to exercise.“It always helps me to take a workout class — just to sweat a little,” my well-meaning friend said as she stroked my unwashed hair. “Just try it.”“Come to the gym with me!” My co-worker begged. “We both need the endorphins.”“How have you moved your body today?” I read on a wellness influencer’s Instagram stories.My family was more direct. “It’s because you don’t exercise,” they would tell me when I confessed how bad my anxiety and depression had become; how getting out of bed was exhausting, how panic attacks occupied all my waking hours, how everything just hurt. How my only relief was the cocoon of blankets that protected me from having to live my life.Research backed them up. Numerous studies have found that physical exercise is meaningfully and significantly associated with self-reported mental health improvement. But my loved ones’ urging and even the peer-reviewed academic journals didn’t seem to account for the crushing weight of depression that kept me confined to my bedroom. Nothing addressed that exercise seemed like a painful chore when everyone around you was forcing it and expecting you to just get happy.Two years later, my mental health has improved — thanks to a lucky combination of effective medication, regular therapy, a career change and, notably, a newfound healthy relationship with exercise. But new habits did not emerge overnight. They came with gradual changes made on my own terms.When the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, I found myself packing up my New York City apartment to move back home with my parents in Washington, D.C. After spending every hour of the day inside with my parents and the flood of Slack notifications and emails, the outdoors suddenly had a new appeal.No one mentioned exercise to me; perhaps they were too busy worrying about a global pandemic and scanning the headlines for more catastrophic news. With no one nudging me — demanding I “fix” myself — I actually wanted to move my body. I even caught myself eying my running shoes in the back of my closet. Somewhere, deep down, I wanted to feel the D.C. humidity on the back of my neck. I craved the burn in my thighs from walking up a steep hill. I wanted to try shedding my cocoon of blankets just to see what it felt like.Naturally, my enthusiasm for walking lasted only a few minutes into my first attempt. After one uphill block, I was winded. My persistent, negative internal dialogue told me I was too out-of-shape, too depressed, too lazy, too unwilling to make a lifestyle change — that I should just give up and go home. I resolved to walk for 30 minutes, just to finish out the optimistic Spotify playlist I had designated for exercise.The next two weeks of walking weren’t much different. I forced myself into running shoes, blasted energetic music through my headphones and dragged myself around my neighborhood, block by block. My internal critic mocked my efforts and assured me that my mental and physical health wouldn’t improve. But I managed to drown her out with enough base drum.On my 20th day of walking, I noticed that my first hill hadn’t left me winded. I had barely noticed it go by. In that moment, I wasn’t overwhelmed with cruel self-talk. I felt something almost like pride.Despite the occasional interjections from my internal bully, I started to have fun on my daily walks. I walked faster and longer. I began jogging every other block. My exercise playlists became more whimsical, as I no longer had to rely on a crushing downbeat to motivate myself.Once moving my body no longer felt like a chore, I found myself wondering about what else I could do. I tried online workout classes and discovered I actually liked them. They gave me structure and purpose during a confusing time that felt otherwise out of my control.In the past year, I have walked an average of 5.7 miles every day. This is a number that would have intimidated me just a year earlier. But I have truly reached a place where moving my body feels safe and fulfilling. Walking has even become a reason to get out of bed on the tougher days.When I need to re-center myself or disconnect from my computer screen, I walk. When I need to work through a spiral of anxious thoughts and negative internalized messages, I walk.I walk without a desire to satisfy anyone else.Walking around the block didn’t cure my depression, but trusting myself to try new habits and make changes on my own terms has been nothing short of a blessing.Margot Harris is the Associate Editor of Marketing and Communications at NAMI.

      "body": "A young client of mine was recently describing her struggles with low self-esteem. She doesn’t like the way she looks on the outside or who she believes she is on the inside. She doesn’t see any good qualities in herself, nor does she feel she has any purpose. She feels she isn’t useful or helpful to anyone and believes she is a burden to others.There’s a natural urge in this situation to try to convince the person otherwise — to help them see the errors in their thinking and to reassure them of their positive qualities. However, I refrained from doing that because I knew she wouldn’t believe me. With people who only experience occasional self-doubt, a pep talk may be helpful and appropriate. But chronic and pervasive low self-esteem is a harder problem to tackle, and it requires a more comprehensive approach.I write from the perspective of an experienced professional counselor, but also from the perspective of someone who has dealt with this issue firsthand. For much of my life, I have been haunted by what I like to refer to as the “demon of self-doubt,” which has often spiraled into self-loathing. I have worked diligently on this issue, and I believe I have made progress. On most days, I can maintain a realistic and balanced view of myself and treat myself with compassion. However, developing and maintaining a healthy self-esteem is an ongoing process. It continues to shift and evolve as I respond to the ups and downs of life.If you struggle with self-esteem, you may be wondering how you can learn to like yourself — especially if, at your very core, you don’t. How do you start to see yourself as a person of value, goodness and potential? My first answer is: It’s hard! It takes time, effort and maintenance. But my second answer is: It’s possible, and the rewards are plentiful.Here are some suggestions to begin your journey toward greater self-esteem.Improving your self-esteem is daunting task, especially if a negative self-view is deeply rooted and long-standing. Therefore, this work requires a leap of faith — a belief that the endeavor is worthwhile and that success is possible. To succeed, you must have the commitment to see it through.This will serve as an anchor to keep you grounded and as a catalyst to push you forward. Take the time to do some research about self-esteem or speak with a professional who can guide you through the process. The more knowledge, resources and support you have, the more likely you will be able to take that leap of faith.Of course, having a healthy self-esteem is not something we can just easily talk or think ourselves into. The client I mentioned earlier told me that when she tries to change the way she thinks about herself, it just doesn’t feel true to her.I told her she can begin by entertaining the possibility that she isn’t as bad as she thinks she is — that maybe her critical view of herself is not entirely accurate. That way, she is not trying to force something that feels rushed or artificial, but rather, open some space in her mind for new possibilities and ways of thinking about herself. To put this another way, experiment with letting the negative thoughts you have about yourself mingle with some positive, self-affirming ones.Another client, who has chronic, debilitating negative thoughts about himself, once said, “Well, I’ve been thinking this way for close to 30 years, so I can’t exactly change it now.” I told him that learning to like yourself when you are disinclined to do so is like building physical stamina or strengthening a new muscle group.I chose this analogy for him because he had recently lost close to 50 pounds. It might feel awkward, uncomfortable and even painful at first, but through practice and repetition, we gain strength, and we feel more comfortable and confident.Another client told me that when she tries to acknowledge her strengths and positive qualities, she feels like she’s showing off or being narcissistic (having an excessive interest in one’s self). I explained that having a healthy self-esteem is not the same as being narcissistic. Having a healthy self-esteem is about having a balanced and reasonable view of oneself as a complex, imperfect human being. It has just as much to do with acknowledging our shortcomings as it is about acknowledging our strengths, skills, gifts and potential.Additionally, a truly narcissistic person would not worry about being narcissistic, whereas a person with low self-esteem would. It is the voice of low self-esteem itself that says: “Maybe I’m showing off,” or “maybe I’m self-absorbed,” or “that makes me sound so narcissistic.”One way to begin the process of increasing self-esteem is by learning to observe your internal dialogue. It requires you to take a figurative step outside of yourself so that you can be an objective observer. Then, you can begin to take note of how you interact with yourself:The point of this observation is to become more aware of the automatic and habitual patterns of thought that feed into your low self-esteem. That way, gradually, you can develop healthier patterns, and a more accepting and loving relationship with yourself.I have found it helpful in my own life to come up with names, visual images or analogies for different issues and challenges, such as my “demon of self-doubt.” Doing this helps me to gain some control over it. It allows me to gain some mental distance from the problem and view it from a different perspective.Low self-esteem can become tangled inside of us, making it hard to manage and overcome. But by naming the problem, we can begin the process of taming it as well.Susie Moore is a licensed professional counselor living and working in Philadelphia, Pa.

      "body": "As an individual with bipolar I disorder, I experience paranoid delusions during manic episodes. Although medication reduces these symptoms, there have been times when my medication was not the appropriate dosage, or I refused to take it at all. This led to times when my delusions and false beliefs led me to engage in high-risk behavior.Through intensive therapy spanning more than 15 years, I learned to recognize my delusional thinking. However, I still struggle to come to terms with my past beliefs, having what one psychiatrist once described as “fixed delusions.”In an attempt the make sense of past events and to shift my perceptions to a healthier way of thinking, I began cartooning. Creating images has become a form of “reality testing” for me, a practice that I learned in group therapy.Reality testing, as my therapist has explained it to me, is the practice of weighing the evidence to support or deny my irrational beliefs. My illustrations depict both my perception of reality during past psychiatric episodes and the logical explanation for events that occurred during these times.I had my first psychiatric hospitalization in June 2007. In the months leading up to my hospitalization, I was depressed and becoming increasingly paranoid. When my uncle died by suicide, I became convinced that he was murdered by my friends. I furiously journaled my fears and suspicions. My writing became increasingly fragmented and incoherent. I believed that federal agents were interrogating me telepathically. I wrote about what I perceived was evidence for their investigation into my uncle’s murder.Then one day, voices in my head told me that I needed to wait on the curb in front of my apartment building so the FBI could bring me into witness protection. According to my voices, I was considered a witness, not a suspect, so they couldn’t approach me lest it appear that I was coerced. I believed that I was to wait on the curb for 10 minutes before a car would approach to rescue me. In reality, I waited most of the day and night until my neighbors finally called 911 to get me psychiatric help.The following cartoon depicts my feelings of desperation that day.The paramedics took me to the hospital where I was placed on an involuntary psychiatric hold. The doctor diagnosed me with depression with psychotic features and prescribed me an anti-depressant and anti-psychotic medication. Since then, I’ve been given several diagnoses, including schizophrenia, schizoaffective and bipolar I disorder.Doctors have prescribed me countless different medications to stabilize me. At times, I refused to take my medication, believing that the doctors used it to control my thoughts and actions. As illustrated below, this led to involuntary hospitalizations and the threat of court ordered injections.After another psychiatric hospitalization in May 2013, I decided that I needed my medication to function. I took it as prescribed for several years and remained stable. However, in 2019, my psychiatrist gradually reduced my antipsychotic medication because I was concerned with the weight gain that I attributed to taking it. When I was on the minimum dosage in November of that year, my psychotic symptoms returned.I began to have conversations in my head again where I believed that I was communicating telepathically to testify in a federal case. These voices ordered me to wander the streets in my bare feet so I could escape from people who were trying to murder me in my apartment. At one point, the voices told me to approach men in the park to ask them where my nieces were. I believed that they were kidnapped (they were actually safe at home).This psychiatric episode ended with me going to the roof of my building because the voice in my head ordered me to. I got locked out of the building and was on the roof for about 24 hours. I was cold, scared and confused. I had visual hallucinations for the first time in my life. I saw giant images of former presidents and fire on the hills in the distance. Voices were telling me to jump off my building to die for my country. I bargained with the voices and told them that I’d overdose when I returned to my apartment.Suddenly, I was able to open the roof door and enter my building. Once I was finally able to get back into my apartment, I decided to get a ride to the hospital to voluntarily admit myself to get the help that I needed. Had I not made that decision, I don’t know if I’d still be alive.Since these episodes, I’ve experienced a long period of stability. My medications effectively treat my psychotic symptoms and depression. However, I don’t always have clarity when I reflect upon the circumstances surrounding my previous psychotic episodes. I have a difficult time determining what was real. I struggle to let go of the delusional thinking that has dominated my thoughts for 14 years.My art has helped with this tremendously. It’s a way for me to see my experiences from a different perspective. It’s through my art, and my commitment to receiving treatment, that I have made progress in decerning reality from delusions in my life, gained a better understanding of my mental illness, and embraced a healthier way of thinking and living.Lesley Paige grew up in the Washington D.C. area and now lives in Los Angeles.

      "body": "The holiday season is typically seen as a time of joy and merriment; of family and friends gathering and celebrating together. However, many have begun to have honest conversations about the darker side of “the most wonderful time of year.”For many with mental illness, or those who have family and loved ones who face mental health issues, these can be tremendously difficult times. Perhaps we hope to feel connected to — and understood by — those around us during upcoming celebrations, only to be disappointed. Or maybe we imagine fulfilling family dinners, only to struggle fitting in. We might plan for parties with friends, only to find we’re feeling trapped in our own minds and lost to waves of depression.These “holiday blues,” however, can be managed. Here are a few ways to create self-care activities to help carry us through the season.The holidays are often accompanied by a long list of obligations, errands and events. While these to-do lists can sometimes be fun or exhilarating, they can also be exhausting and emotionally draining. It’s important for you to know when to say “enough” or “no.” Small, successful outings are much better than running yourself into the ground or over-extending yourself.You can set boundaries around how much time you spend on holiday tasks; plan for an afternoon trip instead of an all-day excursion, limiting yourself to only one or two stores. Don’t forget to take breaks and recharge. Going with one or two friends may also provide support and make the outing a fun activity.Setting limits can also extend to your social interactions around the holidays. Invest your time and energy in relationships with people who are willing to give back. You need not attend every event you are invited to. Some people are emotionally draining to be around. If you need to, protect yourself by declining their invite. A brief phone call to express your “apologies” and to wish them a happy holiday season offers limited engagement and an easy exit.It’s natural to have high expectations of the holiday season; everywhere we look, we’re reminded that this is a time for family, joy and abundance. However, it’s equally important to check in with ourselves about managing our hopes and expectations.Setting unrealistic expectations for people and events can lead to disappointment. Having no expectations is equally unrealistic and conveys that others don’t need to think about you, which can lead to disappointment. An honest and open appraisal of how people have treated you helps to predict how they will treat you in the future.For some, the holidays are a time of painful reminders. If you find yourself triggered by certain activities or interactions, do your best to replace them with emotionally fulfilling ones. If certain holiday movies remind you of sad times or lost friends, don’t watch them.If a problematic relative or acquaintance is going to a holiday event, consider if you really need to be there. And if you do, then don’t actively engage with that person. You can also drop by for a brief check-in rather than attending the full event.Giving back, or helping others out around the holidays, is an excellent way to make a positive contribution and provide a sense of purpose and meaning.If you’re looking for ways to get involved during the holiday season, consider offering support to service members deployed in remote areas or dangerous locations. You can also consider donating time to a local food bank. Another option to contribute to your community is by creating Care Kits for individuals experiencing homelessness.During the holiday season, you may find yourself surrounded by an overwhelming number of decorations. This kind of celebration, however, is not a requirement for your own space. You need not use traditional holiday colors or symbols for decorating (unless they bring you joy, of course). Pick colors that give you a sense of happiness peace, safety, lightness or calm.Consider a soft blanket to snuggle in with or a favorite pillow to cuddle. Choose a color that makes you cozy. Are there certain fragrances that remind you of a special time or place? Perhaps a new scented candle or an essential oil might help make your house feel a bit more like your safe space and sanctuary.While the holidays are an excellent opportunity to look outward and appreciate the people in your life, don’t forget to appreciate yourself. Amid holiday shopping and gift giving, perhaps you can buy or make a present for future you — maybe something that will support your mental health or encourage a new and healthy hobby.Consider mailing yourself a card or two. Think of an encouraging phrase or perhaps write a note reminding you of a strength or a special time. Jot these thoughts down in a card and send it to your future self. Plan that special time to care for your most important commodity — YOU!We, at The Hecht Trauma Institute are wishing you peace and happiness during the upcoming holiday season.

      "body": "Recently, I have been reflecting on a concept I like to call “the laziness myth.” This myth, as explained by social psychologist Devon Price, is born from a workaholic culture and capitalistic ideals. It tells us that our value is derived from productivity and that we are never working “hard enough.”As I have navigated a variety of mental and physical health challenges, I have learned just how damaging this myth can be for those with chronic illness or extensive medical needs.Professionally, I am a mental health specialist. Currently, however, I am not working, and I’m on disability due to chronic illness. My conditions include fibromyalgia, multiple eating disorders, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and complex post-traumatic stress disorder, among others.As I’ve attended to my health issues, I’ve run into stigma — both self-imposed and from others — surrounding mental health and taking time off from daily demands to recover. It has taken me a long time to combat this stigma and to accept that resting when I need to does not mean that I am lazy.Maintaining my health is a job in itself. I attend multiple therapy sessions each week; I work with a psychiatrist for medication management; I also see multiple other specialists for my physical health conditions.Prior to being admitted to the hospital for a severe mental health crisis two years ago, I pushed myself through school to get my Bachelor of Science in Social Work and Master of Social Work. During this time, I was struggling with my mental health and using unhealthy coping mechanisms because I was afraid to get help.I learned how to hide my symptoms from others; I put on an ambitious face and became a “workaholic” so I could feel as though I was succeeding when everything was crumbling around me. It was only after a traumatic loss of a relationship that my mental illnesses became all-encompassing, and I experienced an episode of severe suicidal ideation. I was taken to the emergency room because I was not able to function at all.The hospitalization was a wakeup call that — in order to survive — I need rest. Afterwards, I took time away from school and work to focus on my mental and physical health.Unfortunately, centering my health and responding to what my body needs has not been easy. I feel guilty for taking time to rest or for being unable to do certain things because my health is in jeopardy.For example, many of my medications increase my sensitivity to heat and make heatstroke more likely, on top of my current heat sensitivity due to fibromyalgia. As a result, I often spend summer days inside, and I tend to need more sleep. While I see other people spend extra time outside with increased activity, I find myself feeling guilty, as though I am doing something wrong for needing the extra time to ensure that my body is comfortable and safe.This guilt is often compounded by criticism. Others do not always understand why I am currently unable to work. I have also experienced blatant distaste and outright disrespect from some people who learn I am on disability primarily because of my mental illnesses. As several interactions I’ve had have suggested, rest is often seen as “laziness” and the antithesis of productivity. I used to believe this, too. I was raised to value arduous work above anything else. Needless to say, trying to separate my need for rest from the shame resting brings is something I am still working on every day.Each day is an uphill battle of trying to choose my health and what my body needs first, rather than what others expect of me. Before receiving help, I didn’t set any boundaries when it came to choosing my needs first. It is hard to make these choices — but I have learned to respect my own limitations, set boundaries, and speak up about my health and well-being.For far too long, people have misunderstood mental illness, and this misunderstanding has forced us to be overly critical of ourselves and challenge the reality of our needs. The emergence of a more honest dialogue surrounding mental health, rest and productivity (like in Price’s work) has taught me that it is perfectly acceptable to function differently than those without with chronic illnesses. I have come to understand that taking care of myself and my own needs is a priceless level of productivity that is more than valid.Despite what our world might tell you, your outward “tracked” productivity that results in economic gain does not define your worth. You, right now, without having to accomplish a feat, are worthy and important. You are precious as you are. Don’t let society tell you otherwise.Ashley Nestler, MSW, is a survivor of schizoaffective disorder, borderline personality disorder, fibromyalgia, multiple eating disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and complex post-traumatic stress disorder.

      "body": "As I reflect on my recovery story, I always come back to the ways in which NAMI facilitated my progress. In 2006, when I was 26 years old, I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. For a long time after my diagnosis, I felt alone — like I was the only one on the planet struggling. But when I found NAMI, and became open and honest about my journey, I found my community. After that, things began to fall into place in my life.Four years after my diagnosis, things were seemingly going well. I had weathered many medication changes and reached a point of stability. I was even working as a preschool teacher’s aide because I wanted to help people in some way.Then, my little sister overdosed in 2010. I fell apart; I mourned in every waking moment and even in my dreams. I didn’t want to live, but also knew the devastation that taking my life would cause my family.A year later, I woke from a nightmare. I sat up in bed with a spiritual pull on my heart. I suddenly felt as though I needed to do something to make a difference. I began researching the next day for support groups and programs to help people with mental illness.I contacted the local community mental health center, and they said they would allow me to host support groups in their building. However, I felt I needed to be better educated. Someone suggested I look up the National Alliance on Mental Illness (I wish I remember who so I could thank them), but after finding a group in Bowling Green, I nervously attended a NAMI Connections meeting. Just introducing myself caused heart palpitations because I rarely interacted with people outside my family.In the group, I met successful people who lived with bipolar disorder: People with master’s degrees in social work, therapists and people who volunteered as peer support specialists. I felt like I had finally found my community. I became more involved and volunteered to be on NAMI Bowling Green’s Board. I learned about programs and completed a training that would allow me to facilitate my own NAMI Connections groups.After becoming a board member, a new friend introduced me to the idea of becoming a peer support specialist. I received my certification in July 2014, and soon after, I began working as the first paid peer specialist for Lifeskills, a community mental health center in Bowling Green. In 2014, I also finished my bachelor’s degree from Western Kentucky University. Getting my degree was a goal I wasn’t sure I could achieve, but I did it, and it was one of the proudest moments of my life.I left Lifeskills after two years to work at a state psychiatric hospital; I wanted to go back to working in the community and seeing people go from struggling to living independent, self-directed lives. I’ve been there since 2017, and now I get to see others’ recovery firsthand. It is rewarding and valuable work and gives me a purpose.A decade or so ago, I was hopeless. I had no friends or social network, and I didn’t want to live. Now, because of NAMI, my life is completely different. I have friends and a community. I get to feel like I make a difference.I am now the lead Family Advocate for the state of Kentucky, which promotes supportive employment programs at community mental health centers across the state. I design, write for and edit the NAMI Kentucky newsletter. Recently, I was even named Interim Chair of Bowing Green NAMI, the affiliate I first walked into years ago as a scared and downtrodden person without hope.Now, I get to help make decisions to grow and expand NAMI Bowling Green. I co-facilitate a NAMI Connections group in a new affiliate in Butler County. I continue to work as a peer support specialist.Now, I find joy in every day. Recovery from a mental illness is not linear, and is often a struggle, but that won’t derail my progress. I may have an episode, but I have NAMI, my friends and family, and my coworkers to support me.Of course, I wish my little sister was still with me, but I can’t change the past. Instead, I do what I can to help others know that there is always hope. I’ll hold hope for them until they find it on their own.Rebecca Coursey is the Chair of NAMI Bowling Green and cofacilitates two NAMI Connections support groups. She is a graduate of Western Kentucky University with a degree in English Literature and Writing. Rebecca will be co-facilitating a support group for students of WKU through the NAMI On Campus program in 2022. She is also a mother of two young men.

      "body": "Seeing a psychiatrist, particularly for the first time, can be intimidating. Seeking help can mean confronting the unknowns, like a possible diagnosis. Moreover, trusting a practitioner with your mental and emotional well-being puts you in a vulnerable position. While your loved ones can support you, they can’t treat you — thus, your psychiatrist holds a powerful position in your treatment.A little preparation before your appointment, however, can go a long way. This begins with finding the confidence to self-advocate, as you are the expert in yourself. Only you can best express your goals, values and preferences, and you have the right to take an active role in your care. In fact, new research suggests that active involvement of patients in their health care may significantly enhance outcomes.With that in mind, here’s how you can best prepare yourself for seeing a psychiatrist.One of the best ways to find a qualified psychiatrist is often through referrals from a talk therapist, primary care doctor or member of your support system. If you’d prefer to do your own search, you can use online directories available through mental health publications and websites like Psychology Today. Make sure to research the background and specialties of all psychiatrists you are considering to ensure that they fit your needs. Before scheduling an appointment, ask about insurance coverage.Before meeting with a psychiatrist, you may want to assemble your complete medical history. Be familiar with and ready to share any prior diagnosis, symptoms and a summary of current and past medication regimens (including doses, time periods taken and side effects). If you are unsure about your medical history, you can obtain this information from the clinician who prescribed past medications or your pharmacist.A little at-home education on mental health conditions can be extremely helpful. Read up on your condition, symptoms and possible treatment options. You won’t become an expert, but you can learn enough to ask more targeted questions.Shared decision-making (SDM) is a collaborative approach to making decisions about your care. SDM requires that psychiatrists, chosen family members and patients come to mutual agreement about plans for treatment. Ultimately, this approach assumes “two experts” in the room: The psychiatrist with specialized medical knowledge and the person with the expertise of their lived experience, values, preferences and goals.You can ask your provider if they are familiar with shared decision-making and determine if they will include your thoughts and expertise when deciding about your treatment plan. Knowing up front how you will be involved in your treatment plan will help you decide whether this is the best provider for you.Most likely, you do not feel comfortable with every person you meet. The same applies to working with mental health professionals. It often takes a few meetings to figure out whether you feel comfortable enough to work with someone. Connecting with your mental health professional is key — researchers have found that the quality of the therapeutic relationship (including their warmth, interest and responsiveness to your needs) has been shown to improve outcomes in psychotherapy.After the first few appointments, it is important to consider whether you connect with your psychiatrist. Ask yourself:Difficulties in these areas could suggest that this may not be the right psychiatrist for you. Talk about your concerns with your psychiatrist and decide whether switching to someone else would better support your needs.An effective psychiatrist should be willing to answer any questions you have — respectfully. Dismissing your questions may be a sign that they may limit your involvement in your care. Some possible questions to pose are:In between appointments, it can be helpful to keep a log of your moods, triggers, symptoms, medication observations and any self-care practices. These trends can be useful data to evaluate with your doctor, including progress between appointments. You can also use this information to make a list of discussion points for your next appointment.A meaningful relationship with your psychiatrist is critical to receiving the best care possible. Your psychiatrist’s role is to share their expertise to guide you on your journey, but for the best results, this relationship requires your effort and preparation as well.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "I first experienced mania during my sophomore year of college. My highs were mountaintop experiences filled with euphoria, drama, risky behavior, gambling, substance use and poor judgment calls.Mania is intoxicating and can feel like a force binding all your physicality into a cauldron of energy and creativity. During a manic episode, it can seem as though you are transcending history and yet entangled into it. It can feel “right” in a way that does not make you realize that something is wrong. In other words, when going through mania, it can be hard to recognize what is happening or that medical attention is necessary.If it weren’t for my friends in college who were constantly looking out for my safety and checking in with me every day, I would have likely dropped off the map with my risky behavior, rather than getting help.As I know firsthand how difficult it is to identify, self-assess and manage a manic episode, I want to help others experiencing something similar. Here are my tips on how to navigate mania.Signs of an underlying issue may start in a mostly “unproblematic” manner in your life, such as feeling very energetic or impulsive — this is often referred to as hypomania — but if unaddressed, it can quickly escalate to a manic episode.During an episode, many people experience extreme euphoria, decreased need for sleep and hyper-sexual arousal. Manic episodes often kept me awake for weeks at a time without feeling the need for rest. I have even witnessed patients doing somersaults across the floors of the psychiatric ward, as they were so dysregulated during manic episodes.With specific diagnoses, manic symptoms become more difficult to identify. People with diagnoses that include psychotic symptoms should pay even closer attention to their moods because psychosis can worsen with extreme elevations of mood, which then further complicates a person’s judgment and insight into their symptoms. Sometimes, religious ideation can be indicative of activating psychosis.If you notice any change in your energy levels, thought patterns, impulsivity, etc., it is best to address it right away before symptoms escalate.If you identify that you are experiencing a manic episode, there are several options for reducing the harm to your interpersonal life using self-management and self-regulation tools.One tool you can use is completing Activities of Daily Living (ADL) checklists to remain as independent as possible during an episode of active mania symptoms. Your ongoing capacity to execute daily living activities without incident is always a good measure of how well you are managing your mania symptoms. For example, someone eating, bathing, sleeping and coping with life stressors is on the road to self-managing their symptoms. The more life tasks you meet without incident, the less your manic symptoms are interfering with your life and your goals.Stimulant and drug-induced mania can be just as dangerous as organically, internally driven manic episodes. Considering substance use treatment may be an essential step in managing your symptoms for the long-term.Like most people, even minor stimulant use from caffeine can trigger an episode or lead to self-activation, which means inducing mania by engaging in unhealthy activities or stopping medication without medical oversight.Accordingly, it is critical to consider your baseline mood (everyday mood) when engaging in stimulant or caffeine use like coffee or energy drinks. Understanding your baseline will allow you to gauge, for instance, whether consuming one more coffee or can of soda will trigger a manic episode.Internal and external barometers are essential for knowing your baseline. Listen to your friends and colleagues and take in their assessment (even if informal) of your mood.Ask yourself these questions to create a barometer to self-assess for mania:Some folks find it helpful to create markers in their local environment. Identifying these spots, small safe havens to migrate to when a potential problem may be in the works. For example, when you are feeling speedy on the climb up to mania, locate one of these spots you can go to when you aren’t feeling safe.Examples of safe zones include:Mania may feel good at first, but, ultimately, it will put your safety at risk. So, find safe zones that will keep you protected when you are manic and lacking your usual insight into your behaviors. While in your safety zone or on the way to it, you can begin to recalibrate your internal guidance system to register that you are manic and need to return to a calmer, more stable baseline. Visualize what that will look and feel like to begin the recalibration process.Ultimately, there will be times when you have to live with unresolved symptoms. Creating a plan for friends and family will significantly reduce the risk of potential harm from an episode. Friends and family can also help you make decisions if your judgment and insight are too impaired for rational decision-making.I send warning emails to friends and family, flagging them down when I feel like my moods may have impaired my decisions and/or might affect others in the future. Preparedness and attention to detail are always essential when managing an illness. Surrounding yourself with supportive people and allies can bolster recovery.While you should never feel embarrassed by your behavior during an episode, you do need to accept responsibility for it. That’s how healing works — acknowledging that change is necessary and moving forward in the process of adapting our behavior to build a healthy, fulfilling life.Max E.

      "body": "Looking back, I had all the classic symptoms — and they were severe.I believed someone had to be in the back seat with my son Thomas in the car; otherwise, he’d die. I believed I had to stay awake all night while I was watching him, otherwise, he’d die in his sleep. I feared “the agency” was going to come at any moment and take him back and say he wasn’t mine. These fears were all so real to me — never did I think, “I have an illness, and with help I can get better.”The thoughts got worse, now telling me in detail to commit the gravest sin. I hated those thoughts, the thoughts of hurting my baby, and I didn’t want to listen to them.Day and night, I would be on guard in case they came. When they did come, I would use all my willpower to bury them. It was mentally and emotionally exhausting. I was terrified because I thought, “What if they win and my strength fails me?” or “What if I actually act on them?”When the thoughts kept coming — and their frequency increased — somewhere deep down, my intellect kicked in, and I knew I needed to see a psychiatrist.I still had no idea that I was experiencing postpartum OCD and depression, but I did know the terrible thoughts meant my brain chemistry was off.When I talked to a doctor, he said I’d get better the fastest if I went to an inpatient mental health facility. I agreed, as I just wanted to get better. He described me as homicidal to the facility while trying to secure me a spot. So, that is how I began to see myself. Even after a week in the facility (and over two months of partial inpatient and outpatient therapy), I still believed I was a threat to my baby. I was told I couldn’t be alone with him. No one told me differently. The fear of hurting my baby overtook my whole life. I was no longer me; I was no longer confident, I had no joy, I had no self-love.We all have blessings in our life. Four months after being told I was homicidal, we moved to a different state due to my husband’s new job. I got a new psychologist and psychiatrist who specialized in maternal medicine and therapy. They recognized that my intrusive thoughts were, in fact, symptoms of OCD. They assured me that I wouldn’t act on my thoughts. Their assurance immediately lifted the largest weight from my shoulders. I did not have to fear myself anymore and always be on guard.My therapist taught me how to recognize and ground myself when I had these alarming thoughts. With the professional help I needed, I came to accept that no grave harm would come to my baby, either from myself or elsewhere, so the intrusive thoughts held little weight and no longer effected my day-to-day living.I learned that the people who truly care will still love you. My relationship with my husband is better than it’s ever been (learning emotional intelligence and communication skills in therapy has been great for our marriage). I’m still very close with my family. I know they always want me to do well. I also am fortunate to have the best girlfriends who I still love getting together and having open, honest conversations (I even learned that some also experience mental illness).I learned sympathy for those with mental illness. I understood intimately how some people might not even know that there is a path to recovery — that we just need the right help to get there. Sometimes, we need medicine. Sometimes, we need to train ourselves to think, process and react in new ways.I learned that we need more experienced mental health practitioners and psychiatrists. We need caregivers to be familiar with all the proper signs, diagnoses and treatments for mental health.I learned we need dedicated support for families who are drained from taking care of their loved ones with mental illness. We all need to be checked on; not just “how are you” but “I’m concerned. Please take this mental health survey and let’s see if there are any warning signs.”I learned that mental health should be prioritized early in life (at school and at home). We go to the dentist twice a year to have shiny white teeth. Can we approach mental health the same way? Imagine if everyone was taught that it’s important to go see a professional when you are struggling.I learned I am strong. I am as strong as they come. I opened up about the awful thoughts in my head as I knew something needed to change. I never gave up. I was at a very low point during the period that I thought I was homicidal, but I just kept trudging through. I’m a more joyful person now than I was before this experience.I’m very pleased with all my progress. I still see a therapist weekly and a psychiatrist monthly and take prescribed medications regularly. I hold a professional job in research and development of engineering technologies and, importantly, I love being a mommy.Dr. Patricia DiJoseph lives in Virginia.

      "body": "When I was a teenager, I would frequently remind myself not to be like my mother. My developing brain could not make sense of her behavior, which I would come to learn was actually bouts of hypomania, anxiety and depression. Even when she reached a crisis point and expressed suicidal ideation, I didn’t quite understand what she was experiencing. This was so out of character for her and incredibly disorienting for me, so it felt like my mom had turned into a troubled stranger.A decade later, I would reach my own psychiatric crisis with mania, psychosis and depression. This experience forced me to understand what I couldn’t as a teenager. It unearthed the voice — sometimes quiet and sometimes loud — of mental illness.When I was 19, I graduated from college with a degree in psychology. Starting a full-time job three days after graduation did not seem like too much to handle at the time, but it certainly was.I started getting an avalanche of ideas that I imagined would radically improve the small company I was working for. I would wake up in the middle of the night fully energized to send emails and write things down without realizing how much friction I was creating. These whispers of warning signs didn’t raise a red flag for me because the mania felt so rewarding.However, my mental illness escalated from whispers to shouts after I got fired from this job that was too much too soon. My family took me to a psychiatrist at the mental health clinic where my mom received treatment, and there I was diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. In my confusion and frustration, I believed my family was against me. I also believed that the psychiatrist was monitoring my every move by tracking my smart watch and conspiring with my neighbors. My psychosis had convinced me that he was madly in love with me and wanting to avoid a lawsuit for malpractice.I can’t recall the point when a clinician told me I had bipolar I disorder. I remember talking with my doctor to express my many frustrations. I also remember having a lucid moment when my dad explained my diagnosis. He was incredibly compassionate during that conversation; he understood the disease because of my mom, and he knew to approach the subject delicately. When the mania returned, however, I felt like I had to prove my father wrong. The shouts of a mental illness are resounding when reality is too heavy for us to deal with.Being hospitalized twice in less than a month (and, as a result, having frequent contact with patients who were also suffering from mental illness) helped me get on a path to recovery. I’d hear from peers that had been recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder and started treatment, and I’d listen to stories from those that stopped treatment and needed to restart intensive treatment. I’d also met people who had been in treatment for many years and created beautiful lives with children, serving the community and traveling. Hearing all these stories helped me realize that I can overcome and thrive — it gave me hope that things can get better no matter how awful they seem.I also embraced techniques from interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, which centers on approaching life 24 hours at a time, with a routine for daily activities while also sustaining healthy interactions with a support system. True recovery from my mental illness has taken a village and persistence with maintaining my balanced rhythm.My family’s involvement has also assisted me in my recovery. My parents will often ask me, “Where are we on a scale from one to 10?” with one meaning crisis and 10 meaning euthymia (wellness), which nudges me to be honest, self-aware and to rely on them when needed.Losing my mental health as I knew it before the onset of bipolar disorder involved grieving. Accepting the reality of my diagnosis after denial, anger and depression took time. I refused to take psychotropic medication when my mental illness was shouting, and this distressed me and my loved ones. Nonetheless, I believe that our biggest breakdowns can lead to our biggest breakthroughs.I understand that although the shouts of my mom’s bipolar disorder were loud enough that everyone could hear, she worked tirelessly to remain safe with the whispers of it. She managed to raise three children, practice law in our native country and transition our family to live in the U.S. She was the source of my frustration as a teenager many times, but she has become my inspiration. She has taught me that it’s possible to get through life, with all its challenges, while not losing track of the voice of bipolar disorder.Now I see my medication and coping mechanisms as a safety net rather than a sign of weakness. There are things I need to be mindful of like regular exercise, counseling, attending support group meetings and nutrition. This lifestyle makes it easy to recognize the voice of the mania and depression from my mental illness. We’re all capable of creating a life worth living if we’re willing to listen to the whispers before they become shouts.Yerika Germosen grew up in the Dominican Republic and immigrated to the U.S. in 2013.

      "body": "As I’ve navigated a complex mental health journey, writing has been my anchor. When my life began unraveling, journaling helped me hang on to normalcy and my sense of self. It stabilized me when I was eventually diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder (DID), a mental health condition marked by the presence of at least two distinct personalities. Writing also helped me tease apart conflicting thoughts and emotions during an intense time of therapeutic healing. Then, it helped me create a coherent narrative after I recovered and began to live a happy, fulfilled life. Through writing, I wove a beautiful tapestry from what used to be a jumble of knotted, unkempt threads.When I was 35 years old, my seemingly normal life began to fall apart. My happy marriage was on the rocks, and my wonderful children were acting out. Worse yet, my usual, competent approach to tackling problems disappeared. Someone gave me a journal as a gift, so I began writing.At first, I made lists: What I need to accomplish today. Five things that will help me get through the day. 10 ways to avoid the wrath of my ex-husband. These lists helped me cling to the capable self that was slipping away. I never completed the tasks on the lists because my chaotic inner world would get in the way. Still, they formed the first threads in the tapestry of my healing.In my early 40s, my writing “let loose.” In place of lists, I began spewing words and incoherent phrases into my journal. I didn’t know where they came from, and I didn’t know what they meant. Oftentimes, they were indecipherable, but occasionally they had an almost poetic quality. The deep poignancy of my words made more sense when I was diagnosed with DID when I was 44 years old.After receiving my diagnosis, I began to work with a therapist who helped me take great strides in understanding my condition. She encouraged me to continue writing in my journal — and she pushed me not to “edit” the words as they came out, but rather to give the other voices inside me a chance to speak.Through this process, I was able to get to know the different “parts” I unknowingly created to protect me from chronic early childhood trauma (these “parts,” often referred to as “alters,” are a result of the personality fragmenting in response to sustained trauma). As they wrote more, they had the confidence to speak more. As they spoke more, their trauma began to heal.My parts “integrated” when I was 54 years old. By that time, I was writing poetry and taking pleasure in the imagery my words created. My professional life was growing, and I wrote expository pieces required for work.Even my spiritual life was evolving, and I wrote sermons to express the work of light inside me and the world around me. I did far less journaling because I no longer needed that unbridled expression, but I continued to put pen to paper to convey words nestled deep within me.Today, at the age of 73, I am awed by the power of writing. I facilitate two writers’ workshops and host a website for people with dissociative disorders. The poems, essays and memoirs dissociative writers submit for feedback are rich in thought, in the variety of stories they tell, and in the trust they reveal simply by the writers’ willingness to share. I have learned as much from these writers as they have learned from me.I encourage anyone who is struggling with their mental health to write their way toward healing, too. There is no one way to approach writing, so what I share here are hints. You’ll find your own way.By writing, you will be weaving your own tapestry and honoring the life journey you have taken. Whether you’re writing only for yourself or hope to share your writing with others someday, take your pen in hand (or computer) and write!Lyn Barrett hosts free, virtual Dissociative Writers workshops at www.dissociativewriters.com. Her memoir, “Crazy: Reclaiming Life from the Shadow of Traumatic Memory,” will be released in January 2022.

      "body": "As I sat on the couch ordering clothes for my then five-month-old daughter, my husband — seemingly out of the blue — told me that he was not a good husband and father, he was no longer in love with me, and he wanted to end our marriage.Had I heard him correctly? What was happening?Time froze. The room began spinning. I got nauseous and threw up. I cried. I begged for compromise. I pleaded for answers. We went to bed that night agreeing to stay in separate rooms so we could think things over.The next several months were a rollercoaster of emotions. My husband and I had several long talks, with many tears shed. He eventually moved out, only to move back in several days later. I tried to convince him to go to therapy, but he refused to go, as is common among men struggling with their mental health, largely due to the stigma surrounding seeking help.I’ve dealt with anxiety for most of my life and this situation wreaked havoc on my mind. As someone who already struggled with overthinking and excessive worrying, I was now consumed by my thoughts. I overanalyzed every interaction with my husband and obsessed over the unknowns. I was devastated by the idea that I would miss half my daughter’s life to shared custody if we divorced. My self-esteem plummeted as I considered why I wasn’t good enough for him anymore.Even though my husband was not willing to join me, I decided to seek therapy on my own. At the very least, I figured, I could talk about our issues with a professional and work on my side of the relationship. I loved my time in therapy. I learned things about myself that shed light on my own anxiety and discovered some useful coping techniques.My therapist helped me understand why I become highly irritated by spontaneity or changed plans (loss of/need to control), why I repeat conversations in my head to the point of frustration and exhaustion (rumination) and why I have vivid, morbid daydreams about my loved ones (my fear of losing them). Though I had always known my constant worrying, restlessness and inability to concentrate were signs of anxiety, I hadn’t put together all the ways anxiety impacts my daily life.Realizing this fact, and discovering the root of my anxiety, helped me to better manage my symptoms. Instead of getting angry and frustrated when plans changed suddenly, I forced myself to pause before responding. I acknowledged my fear of change and loss of control, and I learned to think through situations to determine if they were as serious as they felt to me. Most often, they weren’t, and I just needed a moment to process.Going to therapy helped me get through the three years that my husband’s symptoms lasted. That period felt like a dark cloud was hanging over my house. I would come home and sit in my car, staring at the place where I was supposed to feel happy and safe. Instead, I would feel dread wash over me. I would hesitate going inside, knowing I would see my partner in pain.Additionally, I would have to pick up all the slack, maintaining the house, caring for the baby and caring for my husband. I was exhausted — mentally, physically and emotionally. Many days, I was ready to give up. I would think to myself, “just get through today, sleep on it, reevaluate tomorrow.”After about two years, I started to see glimpses of the man I used to know. They didn’t appear often, but they were there. Then one day, after confronting him about some debt I discovered, he finally broke and admitted he had gotten into online gambling and lost a lot of money. On top of that, he was severely unhappy at his job. He felt like a failure.I had spent so much time overthinking and overanalyzing that it was a relief to finally have some concrete answers. Though I was grateful he had opened up, and I felt hopeful things would get better, I was also afraid and unsure. Two years of uncertainty and worrying had taken a toll on me.I suggested again that we go to therapy. He still wasn't convinced. I truly wished he would go with me, so we could have a professional to talk to and guide us on how to move forward. Even though he said no, we still actively worked together on our relationship and his health.We still do not use labels to describe his mental health. If I mention the term “depression,” he’ll avert his eyes and brush it off. I believe he may feel uncomfortable and ashamed, largely due to the enduring stigma surrounding mental illness. I frequently think about how perhaps more people would seek help if, as a society, we were more open about mental illness and more vocal that mental health is not a sign of weakness. If my husband had sought help from a professional, his symptoms may not have lasted as long or impacted me the way they did.However, I’m thankful for my awareness of my own mental illness. My experience and insights from therapy allowed me to cope while supporting my husband. And ultimately, I’m grateful that my understanding of mental health could help him too.I am not one to have regrets as I truly find everything to be a learning experience. This time in my life, and in our marriage, was a painful lesson. We were lucky to get through it, and now, several years later, we are both happy and thriving. But our story’s ending is not necessarily common. Mental illness affects so many individuals and the ripple effect onto friends and family can be devastating.Reducing the stigma surrounding mental illness is critical and seeking help shouldn’t be taboo. Just as we’d go to a dentist for dental issues, we should be going to mental health professionals for our mental health issues. Professionals can help us, and our loved ones, work through our issues far more productively and effectively than we can on our own.A.D. has a background in business management but recently left her career of 11 years to focus on her mental wellbeing and pursue creative passions.

      "body": "How does one describe Indigenous identity?Hundreds of years ago, talks about “Indigenous identity” would not have taken place. We were who we were. The People. The Original People. We didn’t have to explain who we were, what we were doing or what value we brought. We simply existed and thrived.Fast forward to modern times, and our reality is different. Indigenous people must fight for everything: The air we breathe, the water we drink, the land we inhabit. We must fight to exist. However, that fight — against oppression from non-Natives, the government, law enforcement, etc. — is only one aspect of our battle. There is another aspect that hits a little closer to home: The fight to be accepted amongst our own.Naturally, the combination of our complex and traumatic history, ongoing oppression and internal identity crises all weigh heavily on our emotional well-being and mental health. For these reasons, we are seeing upticks in depression, anxiety, suicide and even homicide rates among Indigenous people.It is time that we make our mental health a priority.Now that we are beginning to have more honest conversations — turning a critical eye to history and sharing the current experience of Indigenous people — we are getting to the root of our mental health struggles.We’re shedding light on a rising crisis in the disappearance and murder of Indigenous people; we’re uncovering an ugly past of assimilation in schools; we’re calling out the broken treaties and the ways in which the government still does not hold up their end of the bargain, today. These awareness movements and conversations are critical. However, this exposure to past trauma and generational trauma is painful to relive.Additionally, a harsh reality for many Indigenous people is a fight to exist amongst our own. One painful product of colonialism is its ability to turn a family and a people against one another — in the form of blood quantum (a measure of the amount of Native American blood an individual can prove that they have), certificates of Indian Blood, assimilation of culture and traditions. Comments like “you must be mixed,” and judgments like, “what do you know?” spur a new level of identity crisis.Imagine, for a moment, trying to explain yourself to an aunt or an uncle that, no matter what knowledge you bring to the table, it’ll never be enough. So here you are, not “Indian enough...” for anyone. This kind of rejection compounds the pain of generational trauma and current injustices.As a survivor of domestic violence, sexual assault and sexual harassment by law enforcement, I felt as though I needed to take the fight for my own Indigenous identity into my own hands. I wanted to make sure that every space I inhabited felt my presence. I wasn’t going to be a victim to the atrocities our people have faced anymore. I wasn’t going to end up on the other side of the statistics. I saw a need, because of my own journey, that our women needed a plan. A plan to stand up to power and to preserve our emotional well-being — a plan to ensure our survival.I created the Wisàwca Project to further the Missing & Murdered Indigenous Women & Relatives movement (MMIW). The initiative, which helps families to create a written safety plan to be given to loved ones in the event of a disappearance, acts as a response to law enforcement’s handling of missing persons cases; many of our reports or complaints are met with victim blaming, shaming and stereotyping.Ultimately, this project channels the strength and resilience passed down from our ancestors by saying, “We are enough, we are important and we are still here.” We are still present. I believe this to be particularly impactful for those struggling with mental health because we are taking back our power and demanding to be seen.Indigenous people are born with an advantage, and it flows through our veins. I have been so fortunate to have been raised traditionally by my grandparents and parents, while given the freedom to grow into who I am today. If it were not for this upbringing and reminders of who I am, this work would’ve been impossible.Our culture is beautiful. Our culture is strong. Our culture is resilient. But the emotional and mental toll it can take on one’s life is taxing, to say the least. Additionally, the existing mental health resources aren’t sufficient to keep up with community needs — and many community members don’t trust the programs available to them. Historically, the government systems that were supposed to help failed us.I hope to see more mental health resources readily available — and to see more Indigenous people using available resources. I also hope to break down cultural barriers that prevent people from speaking openly about health. An open, honest discussion is the first step.The fight for our mental health — for peace, happiness and to simply be Indigenous — continues today. Whether it be in the form of hunting, fishing, gathering our traditional foods, beadwork, dancing, working at a restaurant, modeling, playing basketball or taking up graphic design — we all have the same goal, to just be.I don’t think our ancestors ever meant for us to judge each other for how “Indian” we can be. I believe they meant for us to live, be happy, love one another and take care of the Earth and our people. I hope that in advocating for our personal safety and mental health, I’m contributing just a little bit to the preservation and survival of our people for generations to come.Chawnuh muun naampta — We will never fade.Kola Shippentower-Thompson (Tumhiya) is an enrolled tribal member of the CTUIR.

      "body": "After navigating a close relationship with someone who lives with borderline personality disorder (BPD) — and meeting dozens of people navigating similar situations — I developed an interest in better understanding the disorder. To broaden my understanding, I read the existing literature about BPD, completed a NAMI Family Connections class and participated in a peer support group.As an anthropologist, I also took an interest in hearing other perspectives. So, I conducted research, which entailed in-depth interviews with people who have a family member with BPD.Between my own support group experience and hearing the experiences of families who sought help, I have collected a wealth of information that I would like to share with anyone who may be looking for guidance.I’ve learned that it often takes time for family and friends to fully digest the complexities of BPD. Figuring out how to best support the treatment and recovery of a person with BPD can be a complicated process and loved ones may find themselves in social misunderstandings.Parents I interviewed often felt that “no one” in their communities knew anything about BPD. As a result, they were tasked with navigating uncomfortable social situations in addition to caring for their children.As one mother said, “Nobody really understands borderline behavior unless you’ve lived with it. Otherwise, they think you’re just bad parents or you’re lying, you’re making it up.” A father noted, “There seems to be a belief that everything falls in line when you do things right as parents. There’s an idea of ‘best practices.’”Unfortunately, parents operate in a context of unforgiving cultural norms: judgments about not properly raising their kids and punishing social norms of parental self-sacrifice with no time limits. As a result, parents of individuals with BPD lose much of their social life; there is little time for it while providing vigilant care and navigating stigma.Accessing appropriate education and support, however, proved to make a difference. While attending the 12-session NAMI Family Connections course, I noticed that participants first arrived in a beleaguered state struggling to understand their distressed loved one. By the end, most became more self-assured, thanks to our deepened understanding of BPD, our newfound skills for positive interaction with loved ones and the constant reminders to take care of ourselves.This outcome is not surprising, as a wealth of studies underscores the benefits of peer support groups. Participants often realize they are not alone in their difficulties, and they can connect with others who understand without judgment. Moreover, attendees learn ways to simultaneously aid their loved one’s recovery and their own well-being.Taking part in monthly follow-up BPD support groups has also proven to help people become more effective communicators and problem solvers — with institutions and with their loved ones with BPD. For example, one support group participant learned not to take a health insurance provider’s denial of residential treatment for their loved one as a final answer.As for managing relationships, parents reported learning how to better manage tense conversations with their children. One issue that parents often found bewildering was how “anything” could provoke an argument. They registered that popular parenting techniques and verbal responses often backfired. A woman with a background in health care described her daughter’s emotional sensitivity as akin to “burn patients who are so sensitive. I try to remember how painful it is for her being in her skin, how life is so hard for her.”In support groups, however, attendees practice how to improve communications with individuals with BPD. Naturally, there is a learning curve; participants will patiently coach one another on “radical acceptance.” They come to see their loved ones’ actions not as manipulative, but as a reflection of their inability to ask for what they need. Attendees also learn to relate to the emotional basis of the words or action; for example, they learn to relate to their loved ones’ anxiety rather than getting upset with their seemingly rash decisions.One woman I interviewed offered pointers handily capturing many suggestions from the NAMI course and support group.One of the most difficult issues parents face is how to “launch” their young adult toward self-sustaining adulthood, or if that’s not possible, accepting the responsibility to take care of their child long-term. Stepping back in caregiving (with a safety plan in place) could spur the person with BPD to develop greater independence in their path to recovery.Still, I have found parents only reduce caregiving if another critical demand emerges — perhaps if a son or daughter’s substance use or disordered behavior is too upsetting for younger siblings or if there is marital discord or another serious health issue. Listening to peers about these trials, and being heard, is itself an immense benefit of peer support.Going to the monthly meeting via Zoom or in an in-person setting signifies entering and creating a community of mutual aid, where participants can safely talk through culturally, morally and emotionally harrowing decisions. To my surprise, peer support groups also provide comedic relief. Such moments of humor provide space for peers to air the challenges they face and relate to one another.Hearing one another’s stories, weighing different approaches, being reminded of self-care — and at nearly every meeting, laughing over some farfetched situation or observation — is both heartening and beneficial.Maureen O’Dougherty is a cultural anthropologist conducting research on the intersections of culture and mental health.

      "body": "Confession: I’m anxious.In what feels like a former lifetime, I taught psychology college courses and worked as a business consultant, trainer and coach. Given my mentoring roles (and my Ph.D. in psychology) it wasn’t uncommon for a student or training participant to pull me aside and admit that they were suffering from anxiety. The truth is, so was I.Diagnosed with an anxiety disorder more than two decades ago, I’ve been both the giver and receiver of the “I’m anxious” confession. I understand what it’s like to struggle to find the right words, and I know how crushing it feels to receive the wrong response. Even well-intentioned loved ones can exacerbate anxiety with a comment that feels unsympathetic or judgmental.To avoid misunderstandings and hurt feelings, here are five helpful responses when a loved one approaches you about their anxiety.Mental illness is common, and your anxious loved ones are not alone. In fact, anxiety became even more prevalent during the pandemic as people across the globe struggled with an unprecedented health crisis, loneliness and isolation. By reassuring your loved ones that their struggles are valid and reminding them that they aren’t alone, you can help them keep perspective and feel supported.However, remember to tread carefully in this conversation. “You are not alone” does not equate to, “We all feel that way.” There’s a big difference between occasionally feeling anxious and being diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. You don’t want to be dismissive or minimize your loved one’s suffering.Unfortunately, anxiety can spur feelings of shame, embarrassment and isolation. Further aggravating the situation, anxiety can cause people to withdraw from relationships and social interactions. You can help by reassuring your loved one that there is no reason for them to feel shame — that it is a health condition and not their fault; that anxiety has nothing to do with strength or weakness.The best approach is to treat an anxiety diagnosis the same as you would a high blood pressure diagnosis: Without judgement. When both your words and actions show acceptance, you can make your loved ones feel supported and loved.When I feel anxious, I want to run, both figuratively and literally. I want to run away from wherever I am, and I want to run from the internal sensations of anxiety. However, I started practicing mindfulness and am learning to sit with these emotions more. Part of that success comes from realizing it’s ok to not feel ok. There’s a freedom in not “fearing the fear” — in not allowing the anxiety to be present. This helps me to accept that anxiety is simply a part of my life, and it does not have to control my life.To clarify, you shouldn’t tell your anxious loved ones they need a dose of mindfulness. While attempting to be helpful, responses like, “Just relax. Maybe you need to take a deep breath,” can have the opposite effect. While you can support them, you likely will not be able to solve the problem.It’s important for your loved ones to hear, “It’s ok that you feel anxious. I’m here with you. There’s no pressure for you to feel good right now.” This is different from saying, “You’re ok,” which can be incredibly invalidating. Rather, you are making it clear that, “It’s ok that you’re not ok.” This can help them to feel safer, supported and validated. It can also help them to feel safe admitting they are not ok.Chances are, your loved ones have at least a few coping techniques that relieve their anxiety. So, there’s no need to tell them what you think they should do. No one wants to be lectured by their loved one during a moment of need.Instead, it’s best to let them tell you what they need. Perhaps, like me, they get relief from moving. If they need to go on a walk, you can offer to keep them company. Or you can offer to watch their kids (if applicable) so they can walk alone. Additionally, people are much more likely to accept help when it is offered than if they have to ask for it. The key is to simply offer.Mental illness is treatable. Unfortunately, less than half of U.S. adults experiencing mental illness get treatment. There are multiple reasons for this, from lack of insurance to feelings of shame. You may not be able to provide insurance to your loved ones, but you can certainly encourage them to seek help.People are more likely to seek help if they don’t feel judged. Likely, you would never question someone for going to a cardiologist or doubt their need to take blood pressure medicine. Likewise, you should never question someone who needs professional guidance or medication for a mental illness. As a loved one, your role is not to be a doctor, nor an expert, but rather to help your loved one seek the help they need.Ultimately, if your loved ones have an anxiety disorder, the best thing you can do is show them love and acceptance. You can be open and curious without judgement. That’s what works when I communicate about anxiety, both as the sender and receiver.As an anxious mom in search of calm, Melissa Lewis-Duarte, Ph.D., writes about living with anxiety and mindfulness-based behavioral change in real life.

      "body": "Depression is one of the most common mental health conditions in the world; in fact, 19.4 million people have at least one depressive episode each year. Accordingly, you likely know someone who lives with depression — maybe even someone who struggles with it daily.When that someone is your partner, and depression develops a presence in your everyday life, it’s important to find healthy ways to cope.You may ask yourself: How can you love and support your partner while making your own mental health a priority? What can you do to help them, yourself and your relationship all at once?Here are a few suggestions to get started.Because depression is a common mental health condition, most people have a general familiarity with the typical ways in which it manifests. However, everyone experiences depression differently. Many of the core symptoms are the same, such as loss of interest in normal activities, changes in sleeping or eating habits and feelings of guilt or worthlessness. But your partner may experience less commonly known symptoms, like anxiety or anger. They also might be highly functional on some days and in a nonfunctional depressive state the next.When you’re in a relationship with someone with depression, learning more about mental illness should be your first step. There are plenty of widely circulated myths about depression, so doing your research or asking your partner to share their experience with you is important. This dialogue can strengthen your communication skills, improve your relationship and boost your emotional intelligence.Growing this “emotional intelligence” — and developing traits like empathy and self-awareness — can help you to feel more in-tune with and connected to your partner. When you’re acutely in touch with both your partner’s and your own emotional well-being, you both can be there for each other on a deeper level.When you love someone, seeing them hurting or struggling in any way can be heartbreaking. It can often seem like there is no “right” way to support them. Perhaps you try a gentle approach one day and a firmer one the next, only to feel like nothing is working. You might even try taking clues from TV shows that depict depression accurately, like “This is Us.” Unfortunately, the fact that depression impacts people differently means that not even the best screenwriters in the world can always get it exactly right.One of the best things you can do is to simply talk to your partner and ask what they need. Ask what you can do to help them feel supported. It’s also important to maintain balance within the relationship and keep things as consistent as possible. Be compassionate with their needs and understand that those needs may change.Additionally, it can be helpful to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and highlight them to your partner. You can also plan something you know they’ll enjoy. Or, do something that might boost their spirits, like setting up a date night at home if they don’t feel up to going out. Planning a movie marathon, cooking them dinner or having a game night are all great ways for your partner to stay in their comfort zone while allowing you to reconnect and get closer as a couple.Wanting to take care of your partner is a good thing, but it cannot always be your top priority.You can’t take care of someone when you’re completely burnt out — physically or mentally. You may not struggle with depression yourself, but you are more likely to experience mental health struggles if you’re not prioritizing your own well-being. You might start to feel overly stressed, tired and anxious if you’re worrying about your partner all the time.It’s not selfish to put your own mental health first. In fact, doing so will allow you to better support your partner because you’ll have the drive, energy and focus to attend to their needs. Self-care doesn’t have to be something over-the-top and luxurious. There are things you can do each day to boost your mental health:If you love someone with depression, remember that you’re not alone. It can be helpful to talk to someone else about your life and what you’re dealing with. You don’t have to carry the weight of your relationship on your shoulders or sacrifice your well-being in order to support your partner. You can love them and support them while still taking care of yourself.Indiana Lee has a passion for the environment and wellness.

      "body": "Nothing fully prepared me for my daughter’s mental health journey, not even being a nurse with a personal history of mental illness. I am not proud of how I discovered that she was suffering, nor do I recommend it; I happened upon and read one of her private emails. However, I can’t say I regret finding out what was going on with my daughter. That email started a journey that may have saved her life — what I regret is that I was not able to intervene sooner.As I grappled with my regrets, I told myself that I could have prevented my daughter’s pain, and I convinced myself that it was my responsibility to ensure she never struggled again. However, as both my daughter and I have progressed in our mental health journeys, I have learned that my guilt was lying to me — that it placed far too much blame on me and left little room for understanding, healing and acceptance.I want to share some of these lies and how I overcame my negative internal dialogue.I often scolded myself for not knowing what my daughter was going through.I should have seen the signs. There were some signs. Why was I so blind? I am a terrible mother for not being more in tune with my child, for not knowing.With time and reflection, I realized that even good parents can’t always know how their children are feeling. My daughter did not tell me what she was going through for many months; she purposefully hid her pain from me. While it hurts me that she didn’t confide in me, I have come to understand that this was her journey, and she had her reasons for wanting privacy. Ultimately, I had no way of knowing early on.As my daughter struggled with her mental health, I believed that my parenting was responsible for her pain.This is happening because I did A, B and C (insert a moment in time or a decision) and I did not do X, Y or Z. I should have known better. I should have...I could have...If I had only...As I have reflected on the last decade, I have truly come to understand that no one is “at fault” for our situation, and I cannot claim responsibility. My daughter’s mental illness could have had many origins: Perhaps she struggled because our family has a genetic predisposition to mental illness, or maybe she internalized negative messages that our society markets to young women.What I know is that I have done my best in raising her, and I have to trust that I loved my daughter and prepared her for life in every way I know how.After discovering that my daughter was struggling, I slept on the floor of her room every night for more than a month, just to make sure she was safe. I barely slept during this time and felt like I had to track her every movement. If she did not answer the phone, I called all her friends asking if they had heard from her within the last five minutes. I called her work. I gave myself panic attacks doing these things. I locked up every potentially sharp object in my home.With time, I’ve learned that I can’t fix everything, and my daughter has the right to decide how she will cope. It took both time and counseling for me to trust my daughter to care for herself after I discovered she was struggling. I can even remember the feeling of trust returning during a joint counseling session. Ultimately, our relationship and communication improved, especially after I encouraged her to feel empowered to make the best decisions for herself.To any caregivers experiencing a similar internal dialogue, please know that it is ok to go through a process of guilt and doubt. It is ok that you may have told yourself these lies — in fact, it is normal. What I will ask of you is that you don’t get stuck in the lies. Breaking free of blame and guilt will allow you to better care for your loved one.I also urge you to be patient with yourself; one self-talk session wasn’t enough for me to overcome an overwhelming internal dialogue. Talk therapy with trained professionals helped me to understand what I was feeling and how to step back and address it. It took multiple sessions and lots of time.For a long time, I questioned my closeness with my daughter and my abilities as a parent. I thought we were close, but how close could we have been if she didn’t confide in me? Shouldn’t our relationship have protected her from pain?Now, I can tell myself that we were close, and I was there for her. I took action and helped her get the care she needed. As a result of this caregiving journey, she and I have become even closer. We’ve learned so much about each other and about how to communicate; this new closeness is real, raw and growing.My hope is that other caregivers can reach this point, with the support of loved ones and mental health care professionals. I did not get here without caring for myself with the same vigor that I cared for my daughter. By processing my situation and leaning on a supportive circle, I was able to prioritize my own mental health and be strong for my daughter. Caregivers deserve healing, too.I wish anyone in this position luck in their healing. It can be a lengthy process — but it’s doable and worth it.Ginger Robertson, an RN of nine years, entered nursing school the year her daughter started kindergarten in order to better her life. Now 17, her daughter is attending to the University of Dakota, majoring in psychology.

      "body": "I have been married to my husband Rich for 29 years. A large part of my attraction to him was his shyness. He was always a bit reserved, but what I did not know until about five years into our marriage was that he wasn’t just shy or reserved; he had depression, which he had always been masking.My husband kept his symptoms buried; he was able to function and present a happy self to everyone around him, but, as I would come to learn, he was faking it most of the time. When he finally shared this with me, we began looking into treatments immediately.The ups and downs of trying to find the right treatment were incredibly difficult. Rich took medications for about 20 years and seemingly tried every option. It was a frustrating rollercoaster ride; doctors constantly added different combinations of medications to try, but none seemed to work. I started to journal (and still do) to express my thoughts and feelings. I would also make notes about what medications he took, the side effects and how he was or was not progressing.One day, as I was reading an article online, I came across an advertisement for a non-drug treatment option. Normally, I would not click on such an ad for fear of it being spam, but I was that desperate to find a solution.After that, we began to research online for non-drug options. This is when we found a treatment called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), which turned out to be the right treatment for him.We went to see a certified physician in our city, and they determined that Rich was a perfect candidate for TMS, which works by using magnetic pulses to stimulate underactive areas of the brain. Through the years, Rich had adverse side effects from a few different antidepressant medications, but this non-invasive form of brain stimulation was different from the start. My husband was grateful that he could comfortably and safely sit in the doctor’s office and receive the treatment with few to no side effects.I continued to journal and track his progress. We also made a point of creating a routine. I think this is critical for any caregiver — to develop a routine with the person you are caring for, allowing them to focus on recovery and know what to expect. We would do simple things, like have breakfast together and take a walk before going to his TMS treatment or stop for ice cream afterward.Rich started to feel relief after just one week. After several more treatments, his mood really started to improve. It was not instant, but once the light shines in, it shines bright. He started experiencing enjoyment in activities that he had not been able to appreciate in years. He even started making plans with me, like taking road trips. He was smiling!We kept going and made sure to keep our routine intact. I kept journaling and looking back at my notes. The change in him was extraordinary. It was nice to see how far he’d come. He was going outside to garden — I would watch him and think, “Who is this man?”A big take-away for us was finding the right provider and trusting the process. The company we used for TMS treatment has performed more than 4 million sessions and treated more than 110,000 patients. That gave us peace of mind from the very beginning. While this advice is always difficult to hear, you must be patient — recovery doesn’t happen overnight, but I could see him progressing each and every day.As a caregiver, you will likely face a great deal of stress. You are not alone. You don’t have to shoulder every difficulty yourself. You’ll need to accept occasional disappointments but know that depression can be treated.Now, the cloud has lifted. My husband is no longer looking through a veil — he is more inspired and can see and feel the exciting things in life. It is such a different world of happy. As a caregiver and wife, this has changed our lives forever. I have my husband back, the love of my life, and for that I am so thankful.Please, if you try TMS (or any treatment) for your mental health, stick with the treatments and stick to the path together. Depression can be a lifelong battle — don’t stop trying. When you see the positive changes, it will all be worth it.Elsa and Rich met more than 30 years ago at Magic Mountain where Rich was an electrician and Elsa was a ride operator. After dating for eight years, they wed. Though they were living what appeared to be a happy life, inside, Rich was suffering with depression. It was nearly five years before he revealed his mental health issue to Elsa. Committing together to the process of getting better, they now share their story, the power of TMS treatment and how it changed their lives forever.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "I have serious mental illness. As a result, mental illness has become a part of my partner and caregiver Izzy’s life as well. He and I have both learned a lot in our challenging 18-year journey to recovery. We’d like to share several lessons that have helped us to navigate recovery.Helping a loved one with mental illness often begins by identifying where they are in the five stages of change and advice for what you can do accordingly:It’s important to listen for “change talk” and act on it by providing support, comfort and encouragement at each stage. Patience is also required (although loved one should feel empowered to use their best judgment in times of an emergency). Pressuring someone to move forward in their journey may cause them to resist, which may delay treatment.Starting the conversation with your loved one can be critical to helping them get the help they need. The caregiver may need to take the first step to start the discussion, and the best way to do so is to demonstrate genuine interest in your loved one’s concerns.Don’t tell them how you can help — ask if you can help and how. Respect their desire not to talk about the situation. “I need to talk to you” is rarely a good way to start a conversation. When they don’t want to talk, the better approach is to keep gently reminding them that you are there for them if they want to speak.Highly effective tools for improving communication include:It is important to always convey empathy and compassion when speaking with your loved one. This includes talking about the past. Many people with mental illness are aware of some of the inappropriate things they did when ill. In fact, they may often obsess over their regrets and mistakes.It may be best not to raise these incidents if you see that your loved one is actively trying to improve their behavior. Mentioning them may make it harder to move forward in their recovery — they can’t change the past. It can be helpful to instead focus on the present moment and future goals.Mental illness may make a person feel as if they have no say or control over their life. Often, they may allow their caregiver to take control of their treatment because of their difficulty accepting the diagnosis or out of ambivalence. However, self-empowerment is key to recovery.It’s important to ask open-ended questions to explore what your loved one wants and to help them take ownership of their mental illness and treatment. When a caregiver respects and trusts their loved one’s decisions, this can feel liberating and improve the relationship.Treatment approaches can also be self-empowering. A shared decision-making approach can be very effective. With this approach, a patient makes clear to their doctor what their priorities are, and together they agree on a treatment plan. An approach designed to help patients pursue life goals, rather than merely addressing symptoms and side effects, can be extremely motivating.Caregivers should strive to recognize and praise all accomplishments. When your loved one it severely depressed, getting up from bed, taking a shower or eating can be extremely difficult for them. Doing any of these is an accomplishment. Don’t mistake a depressed person’s inactivity as laziness.Recovery is often a series of small accomplishments. Small accomplishments can build into big strides, such as getting a job or getting your own home. Encourage your loved one to dream and pursue goals and help them along the way with practical and realistic advice.Helicoptering is a form of a caregiver’s over-involvement in their loved one’s care. Plainly stated, a person feels under constant surveillance as a caregiver “hovers” around them, constantly on high alert for an episode or other adverse event. To a person with mental illness, this over-involvement and anticipation of the worst-case scenario can feel suffocating, disempowering, discouraging and even enraging. Despite a caregiver’s good intentions, helicoptering can lead a person to withdraw and isolate.A common instance of helicoptering is when a caregiver repeatedly insists on contacting their loved one’s psychiatrist, leading the patient to feel like they’re being “snitched on.” This fear may be based on the control a psychiatrist has on their treatment, such as the ability to make a medication change. A person may also feel that a psychiatrist will give deference to the caregiver rather than the “sick” patient. All of this may lead to a significant and harmful erosion of trust between the person and their caregiver — as well as the patient and their provider.Many caregivers do not realize the serious consequences of this sort of helicoptering. For example, their loved one with mental illness can revoke or put limits on the permission their psychiatrist has to speak with caregivers in the future.Peers can support, inform and inspire each other’s recovery journey. In fact, people with mental illness are often more comfortable speaking to peers than clinicians. Peers have insights that clinicians without lived experience cannot offer; moreover, peers in recovery can offer invaluable hope to both supports and people living with mental illness.Understanding is critical to a good relationship between a person with mental illness and their caregiver. While mental illness is very often a family effort, it cannot be overemphasized that a person’s responsibility, ownership and self-empowerment will enhance outcomes. When a person is provided more control over their treatment process, they are more likely to reach recovery. Ultimately, that’s what caregivers and their loved ones should be striving for, together.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

You can also get crisis text support via the Crisis Text Line by texting NAMI to 741741.“How are you feeling?”Think about the last time you asked your teen that question. Most likely, what you were really asking was, “Are you physically sick?” And, if you’re anything like me, you immediately entered “fix it mode” if your kid expressed even the slightest physical issue. Doctor’s appointments. Medication. Nourishing meals. As parents, we prioritize our kids’ physical health almost instinctively. But what about their mental health?For as long as I can remember, “How are you feeling?” was a question I asked only if my children were home sick from school. My perspective on those four words changed forever in March 2018. While my wife and I were away in Mexico celebrating her birthday, we got a text message from our son, Ryan. He told us he loved us and said goodbye. Then, he took his own life — our talkative class clown and gifted storyteller was gone at 14 years old.As I write this, youth suicide is affecting families across the nation. Since 2007, the suicide rate among American youth ages 10 to 24 has increased by almost 60%. In September 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, kids ages 11 to 17 reported the highest rates of suicidal ideation compared to any other age group.In the months following Ryan’s death, I absorbed the disheartening statistics. Then, I spoke with countless doctors, community leaders, experts and parents about youth mental health. Through those conversations, I came to believe that parents should start getting more involved with their kids’ mental health.I’m not a psychologist or a mental health expert. I’m a guy who lost his son and spent the last year and a half trying to figure out why. But I do know this: If we foster emotional connections with our children, tell our stories and acknowledge our kids’ mental health, we can make critical changes.I believe these changes can start with rethinking those four simple words: “How are you feeling?”Plenty of parents have all barged into their teens’ rooms and told them, “We need to talk.” This, I believe, isn’t the recipe for meaningful conversations. That room is their sanctuary — their safe place. Your child isn’t likely to talk with you in this situation, let alone open up about their mental health.Instead, find the place and time when your child wants to talk. Maybe that will be when you’re driving to school or, if you’re like my older son and me, during a round of golf. My conversations with Ryan would usually come after watching a movie together. Looking back, this was a missed opportunity for a deeper connection. At the time, I didn’t know how to ask the right questions.When you’ve identified the right time and place, ask your child, “How are you feeling?” Then, listen and go deeper. If they say they had a rough day with friends, don’t shrug it off. Ask how that event made them feel and acknowledge what they share.These early conversations will help your teen get comfortable sharing how they feel and why. But they’ll also help you get comfortable with reality: You can’t necessarily fix every emotional challenge your child has, no matter how hard you try. The sooner you leave behind the urge to “fix it,” the sooner you can forge a meaningful emotional connection.I often describe the dynamic like this: If Ryan and I are outside on a sunny day, I can say, “What a beautiful day.” But he’ll still think it’s a cloudy day. Parents have to let their kids experience cloudy days; otherwise, they’ll stop sharing as soon as things get tough. A big part of that process is letting go of the “I can fix it” mentality. But it’s equally important to show your kids that you have cloudy days, too.One of the biggest mistakes I made with Ryan was making him feel as though everything in my life was perfect. When everything in his life wasn’t perfect, he hid it. By sharing our own experiences, we can help our teens put their feelings into context — when things are going well and when they’re not.Once your teen is talking openly about their emotions, keep listening and asking questions. If what they tell you sounds serious or raises any self-harm warning signs, it’s time to broach the subject of suicidal thoughts.Approach the topic by asking your teen a question such as, “Have you ever felt bad enough that you’ve thought of hurting yourself?” Many parents feel uncomfortable with this question. The ones I’ve spoken to often worry that the mere mention of suicidal thoughts could put the idea into their child’s head. However, we’re living in a world with endless content — both helpful and harmful — at our children’s fingertips. Your teen has heard about suicide before. And studies show that talking about suicide does not increase its prevalence.If your child has considered self-harm, explore the “when” and “how.” Are they currently thinking about self-harm? Do they have a plan to act on these thoughts? If the answer to either of those questions is “yes,” it is time to seek professional help. If your child doesn’t have a plan, keep talking. Make sure they understand that thoughts alone don’t make someone suicidal. Then, you can share your own experiences with mental health to help them understand their feelings.Ultimately, when our children are unwell, we make sure they get the help they need. To prevent teen suicide, we need to approach our children’s mental health with the same sense of compassion, care and ownership as we do their physical well-being. Talking about suicide isn’t necessary for every child and every situation but asking “how do you feel?” always is.If you or someone you love is having thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK.

      "body": "I knew when I was 16 years old that I would spend my life in some sort of service to others. My mother was the director of the local women’s shelter, a “Back to Work” program for unemployed miners and the local food bank.I was often recruited to volunteer for these different organizations and other community outreach groups. I grew up in the shadow of the Berkely Pit, the largest superfund (toxic) site in the world and witnessed the loss that devastated my community when the price of copper plummeted and mines shut down. I understood early on the complexities of generational poverty, grief and mental health struggles — and how this shared, lived experience shaped all our lives.Naturally, this background informed my interest in community development and health care — but what truly shaped how I work as a provider was my daughter’s struggle to access adequate mental health care in our home state of Montana.Early on in my training, I knew I wanted a career in public health; I was more interested in the prevention of disease than the treatment of preventable diseases. I worked in homeless shelters, prisons, half-way houses and on the streets — bringing health care to people in a way that was accessible without judgment. It was hard work, and I loved it, spending nearly two decades doing this work as a public health nurse.I was at the top of my career, taking on leadership roles and implementing programs for delivering health care to the community, when my life shifted. Everything changed — dramatically and with such force that even now, it is hard to understand — when my 13-year-old daughter started struggling with anorexia and bulimia nervosa. We knew she needed help. Yet, even with all my experience in improving access to care in a rural state, I was suddenly incapable of getting care for my own daughter.At the time, there were only a few nearby therapists who understood the complexities of eating disorders, and there were absolutely no inpatient facilities that provided the medical and psychological support in the entire state of Montana.This meant that for 10 years, my daughter’s necessary inpatient care took place exclusively out of state. Hundreds of thousands of dollars later — and days lost pleading with insurance companies, getting her to appointments, finding tutors, tracking down skilled therapists locally and trying to maintain my career to keep my health insurance — we were all exhausted.Our family was not the only one struggling to find and afford care. At work, I began doing home visits with new mothers and their babies, and I discovered that many of these young women were grappling with untreated psychiatric illnesses and comorbid substance use disorders. Like with my daughter, my responsibility to help my patients find quality psychiatric care felt nearly impossible.Witnessing these unacceptable barriers to and gaps in care inspired me to pursue an advanced degree in nursing, leaning heavily on my public health roots, but with a focus on access to supportive, psychiatric care. I wanted to provide mental health services to patients in need, meeting them in their homes and assessing the environment, culture and family dynamics, all of which drastically impact mental health and well-being.The pandemic has illuminated the mental health crisis in the state of Montana, but it has also created an opportunity to demonstrate the power of telehealth to connect people to quality psychiatric care in their homes. I am now working for Frontier Psychiatry, a company of passionate, dedicated psychiatrists, psychiatric nurse practitioners and family practice practitioners who deliver psychiatric care via telehealth appointments across the entire state.After 10 inpatient hospitalizations and thousands of hours spent in therapy, my daughter Maggie is thriving. She is a fierce advocate for quality psychiatric care for all Montanans and believes in the power of open dialogue and vulnerability.She is a force — and I am a better mother, nurse and human because of her influence. Indeed, it is the brave, innovative people, like my daughter and the founders of Frontier Psychiatry, who make access to quality psychiatric care not just a possibility, but a reality.Larisa Hammond is a family nurse practitioner, working with Frontier Psychiatry in Bozeman, Montana. She and her husband Rob own a tire store and have raised four children. They are expecting a granddaughter in December.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "As a parent, I’ve learned that it can be unbelievably difficult to recognize that your child is suffering from an illness of any kind, least of all a mental illness. After navigating the maze that is the mental health care system, I discovered that early detection can help reduce the severity of mental illness. This only served to fuel my guilt that I had failed my son.I’ve often wondered: How did I miss the signs?My son Frank had been the “perfect” child. He was happy, fun-loving and intelligent. He was a skier, skateboarder, guitar player and one notch from Eagle Scout. Most importantly, he was the child who sat with the new kid in the lunchroom at school. There was never a doubt in my mind that a bright and happy future awaited him.The changes were gradual. His grades began to slip, then came minor skirmishes with friends, followed by small white lies. He was spending more time alone in his room. Eventually, he refused invitations to do the things he loved. More and more frequently I’d find him staring into space.Deep down, I knew these might be signs warning me of trouble. But when I confronted him, he would turn on a thousand-watt smile and tell me I worried too much. He assured me that he was fine and no different from any other teenager. So I dismissed it all as adolescent angst.For parents, certain milestones in our children’s lives are etched permanently in our minds, usually triumphs and achievements. However, for me, one particularly painful memory endures: The day I received a phone call from the police telling me that my 17-year-old son had been arrested. My first thought was that surely the police had made a mistake. But Frank had been positively identified. He and another boy had broken into a classmate’s home and stolen a CD player.When I arrived at the police station, and they brought Frank to me, I immediately noticed that his face looked different. It was as if strings were pulling on the corners of a smile that was twisted on his face. Rather than question him, I held him tightly and told him he would be fine. Shortly after, he was released to my care until his appointment to appear before a juvenile court judge.Once before the judge, Frankie received a stern lecture. She ordered him to return the stolen property, to perform eight hours of community service a week for the next four months and to submit to weekly drug testing. Frank was respectful and apologetic. He was assigned to a maintenance crew in our town center. Every Wednesday, he went for his drug test. I allowed myself to feel a sense of hope.Then, the phone call came that would change our lives permanently. It was the judge’s office. Frankie had failed the drug test. And this hadn’t been the first time. The judge had spoken to my son and warned him of the consequences of getting high and ignoring her ruling. The judge then sentenced him to the county’s juvenile detention center for six months. He was scheduled to be transported the following day.Frankie remained rigid in his insistence that it was such a “minuscule amount of pot!” He even laughed when I questioned his disregard for the judge’s orders. And then he just shut down. I hugged a wooden statue of my son who gruffly pulled away from me. He said something about his cell phone that I didn’t understand. More signs I was unable to decipher. I wept openly as he walked out the door flanked by a social worker and a county officer.It was during the second month of Frankie’s incarceration that I received a certified letter from the detention center’s medical unit. He had been diagnosed with acute paranoid schizophrenia. He was severely withdrawn, hearing voices and, according to the doctor, completely out of touch with reality. They were prepared to start him on a strict regime of medication for which I had to give my consent.My rational mind fought against my desire to shut down. It was as if I’d been looking at our lives through a different lens. Past events began to make more sense. Schizophrenia began as a fine mist that thickened over time until my son and I were enveloped in an impenetrable fog.I sensed that if I didn’t begin to learn about this disease, my son might remain in his haze of delusion and paranoia. And so began our journey — one that has been, and will continue to be, a lifelong effort.First, I spoke to several psychiatrists referred by our family physician. I read up on anti-psychotic medications and worried about the terrifying side-effects. Along with a psychiatrist who specialized in the treatment of schizophrenia and permission from Frankie’s doctor, I even coordinated the delivery of a more powerful drug to the detention center’s dispensary.I called the charge nurse at the detention center daily to check on my son. She assured me my son was getting the proper care. She also told me that even though Frank was struggling with his symptoms, he always tried to smile and often whispered “thank you” to any nurses that visited. This information made me hopeful that people might look past my son’s diagnosis and see the amazing young man that I knew.Many prayers and small steps later, I had the good fortune of meeting Kathryn Hunter, the then-Executive Director of NAMI Collier County. After meeting Kathryn, I was no longer alone in my search for answers. She stressed the need for embracing every available resource (of which there were many).She suggested my husband and I attend the NAMI Parents Group, a peer-led group that shared the challenges and successes of those facing similar experiences. Most importantly, she introduced us to the Florida Assertive Community Treatment team (FACT), which became an anchor throughout my son’s journey to recovery.FACT, an interdisciplinary approach, offered 24-hour, seven-days-a-week care to people with severe mental illness. She advised us to make FACT our first stop upon our son’s release from the detention center. The orientation to the program gave us a refreshing sense of security, knowing that our son had a psychiatrist, caseworker, therapist and nurse who were only a phone call away.These mentors and resources made all the difference. Frank was able to get on the path to recovery and work toward the life he deserved. Kathryn’s inspiration, and the concern of the many advocates we were privileged to meet along our journey, have kept us committed to share our experiences and spread hope to those also battling this illness.Patty DeMauro, an avid supporter of NAMI Collier County, brings 30 years of experience to her retail store: Patty’s Apparel in Naples.

      "body": "If someone you love experiences a mental health crisis, do you know where to turn for help? Would you call 911 hoping that the person who responds has been trained in de-escalation? Would you go to the hospital emergency room hoping that your loved one won’t be left to sit there for days? Too many people live in fear of what will happen when they reach out for help.Unfortunately, the statistics show that, too often, people in mental health crises experience tragic outcomes. According to The Washington Post’s database of fatal police shootings, one in four people shot and killed by police between 2015 and 2020 were people with mental illness. More than 2 million people with mental illness are booked into our nation’s jails every year. And tragically, more than 48,000 people died by suicide in the last year.It doesn’t have to be this way. People who experience a mental health crisis deserve a mental health response, not a criminal justice response. When someone experiences any type of physical health crisis, they expect to be able to call 911 and receive an appropriate health care response from EMTs. NAMI is working to create a system where someone experiencing a mental health crisis can also have expectations to receive a crisis standard of care provided by mental health professionals.In the fall of 2020, Congress passed the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, creating a nationwide number — 988 — for mental health and suicidal crises. The Federal Communications Commission has acted to make 988 available in every community by July 2022.The upcoming rollout of 988 means that mental health advocates have an opportunity to push for not only crisis call centers that can respond to 988 calls locally, but the other components of a crisis response system (listed below). The argument for making these changes now is simple: When someone dials 988, we need to make sure appropriate mental health services are available on the other end to respond to a range of crises. We need more than a number.In 2020, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) published crisis guidelines that outline a standard of care for mental health crises, including:Currently, very few communities across the country offer anything close to the standard of care for these services. Without adequate crisis response services, communities are left to depend on law enforcement and emergency departments that are often ill-equipped to help someone experiencing a mental health crisis.NAMI is advocating at the federal level for resources to help states and local communities expand their crisis services. Additionally, many NAMI State Organizations are working with partners to advance state legislation that will define the requirements around crisis services and ensure funding is available for these services.Many states are looking to charge monthly fees on telephone bills, which was outlined in the federal legislation creating 988, and is similar to how 911 is funded. For example, Virginia, Washington, Nevada and Colorado have all passed legislation that included these monthly fees.Ask Your Elected Officials to Support Mental Health Crisis Services\nAt the federal level, you can urge Congress to prioritize NAMI’s work surrounding crisis response by visiting our Advocacy Center at nami.org/crisisadvocacy and joining our efforts. At the state level, you can check with your NAMI State Organization to see if they are working on this issue and add your voice to their efforts.Reach Out to Your Elected Officials to Share Your Story\nWhile data informs policy work, stories move policymakers. Your representatives in your local community, state capital and Congress need to hear from you. Many have never considered what they would have to do if a loved one was experiencing a mental health crisis, so hearing first-hand accounts of what you or a loved one have gone through can help them understand the gaps in our existing mental health system.These are the important points to hit in any type of communication with an elected official:1. Introduction\nShare where you live (so they know you are a constituent who lives in their district), your connection to mental illness and why you are writing/calling/meeting with them.Example: “I’m here to ask for your support for mental health crisis services.”2. What Happened\nBriefly (written in one paragraph or said in 30 seconds) share a little about your or your loved one’s crisis — what you experienced, how it impacted you and others, etc.3. What Helped\nShare what went well when you sought help. If it didn’t go well, share what alternatives would have made the experience better or led to a more positive outcome.Example: “I would have been less threatened if I was met by a mobile crisis team staffed by plain clothes mental health professionals, but instead, I was met by law enforcement officers, which made me panic.”4. How Are You Different Today?\nShare where you/your loved one are today, focusing on things that are going well, if possible.Example: “Since her crisis, my sister got the help she needed to get well and stay well. Today, she lives on her own and is working toward her college degree.”5. What Is The Need Or Problem?\nTransition from your story to the larger issue you want addressed.Example, “After many tries, my family finally got my nephew the care he needed, but not every family is so lucky.”6. What Will Help Others\nLet your listener/reader know what solution will help people in crisis.Example: “Making sure there is a range of services to help anyone in crisis, no matter where they live — including crisis call centers, mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization programs — will help ensure no one in mental health crisis falls through the cracks.”7. What You Want Them To Do\nClose your communication by making a specific request.Example: “Please support [insert local initiative bill number or name], which will require all crisis services to be available and implement a fee on all phone bills to fund these services. Everyone deserves to be able to access the care they need when they are in a crisis.”Look for Opportunities to Share Your Story Publicly\nWrite a letter to the editor in your local paper about why the mental health crisis system in your community needs to change. If there is a 988/crisis services bill moving through the legislature in your state, look for opportunities to testify and share your story with the legislative committees considering the bill.Engage Other Advocates\nTo reimagine our crisis response system, we will need support from a large variety of stakeholders. Engage other mental health advocates, but look beyond the traditional mental health community, too. Hospitals and emergency departments, law enforcement, EMTs — they all see the impact of inadequate crisis care and are natural allies.Seek out social justice groups, housing advocates, substance use organizations and others who intimately know what the impact is when our crisis system fails us. The more voices, and the more diverse perspectives, the further our message can reach.Be Patient\nChange doesn’t happen overnight. While some states are moving quickly, others will need more time to build support. 988 will go live next July, but even if mental health crisis services aren’t fully in place by that time, every small step forward is progress.NAMI advocates are here for the long haul, and we won’t rest until people experiencing mental health crises can receive a mental health response everywhere in this country.Join NAMI's REIMAGINE Week of Action, Nov. 15-19Hannah Wesolowski is the Director of Field Advocacy at NAMI.*988 will not be available nationwide until July 2022, but if you or somebody you know is in crisis now, get help by texting “NAMI” to 741741 or calling the Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.Note: This article was originally published in the Fall 2021 issue of Advocate.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "During the first few years of my husband’s journey navigating mental illness, people often told me that I needed to take care of my own health. When they offered this advice, I thought, “Sure, eventually. But we need to devote all our energy to getting him through this, and then we can focus on my health again.”Four years later, my husband finally stabilized to the point where he no longer required hospitalizations. The constant worry about his health, however, had taken its toll on me. I felt constantly on edge; every symptom my husband displayed sent me into an anxiety spiral. Amid the stress of helping my husband recover, I forgot an important lesson: You need to help yourself before you can help others.To anyone who may be caring for a spouse or loved one and grappling with guilt when taking time for yourself, please remember that you are worthy of time and care — and the better you care for yourself, the better you can care for your loved one.After reflecting on my journey as the spouse of (and caregiver for) someone living with mental illness, I have identified four practices that improve my health and my relationship with my husband.When your spouse is ill, caregiving and balancing life’s challenges tend to throw off your typical routine, which I have found is key to maintaining your own health while caregiving.Articles promoting self-care measures are constantly preaching the benefits of getting a massage or taking a bubble bath. The reality of the situation, however, is that one massage or one bubble bath is not going to fix a life that’s off-kilter. Rather, you need to develop daily habits that sustain you.I have found that exercising helps me feel more energetic and balanced. I follow this with a daily devotional of studying religious texts, praying and sometimes meditating. Taking time for these activities each day reduces my stress and helps me more effectively tackle everything on my to do list. I also take daily walks in the afternoons and make sure I’ve taken time in the week to talk with a family member or a close friend.This routine is what fulfills, relaxes and encourages me &mdashes; and I stick to it, even when my husband is unwell. I encourage you to cultivate the daily habits that sustain you, and to maintain these practices even during stressful times.Another critical step in maintaining your own well-being is forming a trusted circle of people who can help you care for your spouse. This group should be informed of your spouse’s health condition and willing to step in when you need support. All the caregiving should not and cannot fall to you. Sharing the load prevents you from burnout and strengthens your relationship with your spouse as well.Finding and developing this inner circle can be challenging. It requires an honest conversation with the people in your life; let them know what’s going on and what you might need. For me, this circle includes family, a few close friends and religious leaders. When my husband and I are struggling, I can reach out to them for help without having to explain the situation.Recently, when my husband was struggling, I had to take on more household responsibilities on top of taking care of him and balancing a difficult work schedule. On top of it, my family coming to town, which added extra work to my plate. So I asked my mom to spend a few hours helping me once she arrived. She was happy to help, and I felt some of my burden was lifted.Relying on your trusted circle means asking for help when you need it. This can make you feel vulnerable, but often you’ll find that there are people willing to help, they just don’t know how. Being clear about your situation helps them help you. It’s also important to remember that the loved ones worthy of your confidence will be understanding when it comes to your spouse’s mental health condition.When your spouse is struggling, and you’re shouldering much of the caregiving responsibilities, you’re going to need to talk about your experiences. Bottling fears, thoughts and even resentments can make these feelings even more powerful and hurtful.One option is to share with a trusted family member or friend. If you don’t want to betray your spouse’s trust by talking in depth about their health and struggles, you can talk about how the situation is affecting you. Your feelings are valid and worthy of attention.However, perhaps the best source for guidance and support is the right therapist. I say the “right therapist” because some are going to be a better fit for you than others. You may want to gather recommendations and meet with several practitioners to see what relationship fits best. Personally, I found that when I sought treatment for my anxiety through therapy and medication, my capacity to support my husband was greatly enhanced. I had the same life struggles as before, but I felt better able to handle them.I’ve also found support groups to be extremely helpful. Being able to talk with others in a similar situation and share wisdom from your mental health journey is so important. I attended a NAMI Family-to-Family class and then a NAMI support group for spouses and partners, both of which I would highly recommend. As I heard other people talk about their situations, I felt that I wasn’t alone in my struggle. Being able to offer friendship and advice to others in similar circumstances also brought meaning to my challenges.My final recommendation is to look for the good in your life. If your spouse is struggling with an illness, it can feel like your life turned out much differently than you imagined — and this can be a painful realization. But there are always going to be small victories and unexpected joys. Keeping a gratitude journal and looking for the small blessings will sustain you. This also provides a unique opportunity to notice your spouse’s strengths and what you love about them.Even in my husband’s lowest times, his love for me has never wavered. Once while he was in the hospital, he made me a beautiful origami flower. I put the flower in a vase and will keep it for the rest of my life as a reminder that, while our lives may have turned out differently than we planned, our love for each other is always there.I hope that you, too, have your own “origami flower” to hold onto during the darker times as you hope for a better tomorrow.Erin P. is a writer and English teacher living in Virginia with her husband.

      "body": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a severe mental health condition marked by frequent mood changes, an unstable self-image, and intense and unbalanced relationships. While the disorder’s basic description and diagnostic process seem straightforward enough, the lived experience of the disorder is far more complex.While there are nine criteria for diagnosing BPD, there are many variations of the disorder. This means that each person’s experience is unique and is likely to present quite differently. Unsurprisingly, then, BPD is one of the most misunderstood mental illnesses, and the diagnosis is often accompanied by misconceptions that negatively impact the lives of people who have the disorder. This has been my experience since being diagnosed.Helping others, particularly those close to us, understand the day-to-day realities of borderline personality disorder can be a daunting task. As I have navigated conversations with family and friends, I’ve learned that what matters most is speaking my truth to the best of my ability.Speaking out is how I — and, hopefully, others — can promote understanding and, subsequently, empathy for everyone impacted by borderline personality disorder.In order to describe my experience with BPD to people who are unfamiliar with the disorder, I first list the nine diagnostic criteria:However, while presenting someone with the criteria is an excellent way to introduce them to the basis of what the disorder is, it can be difficult for them to fully comprehend and relate the symptoms of BPD to your personal story. This is why I try to communicate the symptoms that I personally experience with BPD and translate them in ways that are more understandable.My experience navigating conversations about mental illness have taught me that people generally do not understand how severe and debilitating symptoms can be — or how much work goes into addressing symptoms. They do, however, tend to understand severity of physical injuries and symptoms.For example, I tell people that my intense emotions and mood swings often feel physically painful. When I am heartbroken, it feels as though I have full-body injuries, and I am unable to think clearly, which often leads to impulsive actions. In these circumstances, my actions may seem manipulative, but they often come from a place of experiencing intense emotional pain.In likening my symptoms to physical symptoms that someone else can relate, I have found that I’m more likely to relay the in-body experience and severity of my symptoms. This approach provides a higher chance of validation, while also creating a connection and igniting empathy.Unfortunately, I have come to find in my journey that BPD is often portrayed negatively in the media and in popular culture. The symptoms of the disorder are often used as a plot device or in a headline to inspire fear, ultimately furthering stigma and oppression for those living with it.While highlighting the difficulties of the disorder is important in an open conversation, I also prioritize sharing the positives. For example, individuals with BPD tend to feel emotions intensely (and more strongly than many of our peers), which means that we experience love, happiness and excitement to a higher degree, which often makes many of our relationships more exhilarating. We often experience intense connections, and while relationships certainly have the potential to become unstable, they are often deep and meaningful.Finding the positives in my symptoms of borderline personality disorder has not only helped me explain the condition to my loved ones, but it has also helped me to better connect to myself and release the judgment I placed on myself for having this diagnosis. Those with BPD are often some of the most empathetic, understanding people that I know, and we all deserve to be understood rather than judged based on the stigma surrounding this illness.My hope is that people will be able to see borderline personality disorder in a more positive light, and that people living with the disorder will be able to relay their experience more easily to their loved ones.Ultimately, people with BPD deserve the understanding of others who can see the whole person — not just a diagnosis.Ashley Nestler, MSW, is a survivor of schizoaffective disorder, quiet borderline personality disorder, fibromyalgia, multiple eating disorders, generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder and Complex PTSD.

      "body": "One aspect of psychiatry that distinguishes the discipline from many other forms of medicine is ambiguity. While we know that a biological component likely underlies mental illness, we don’t know exactly how that biological connection works.Most researchers agree that people with mental health conditions have a genetic predisposition to their illnesses — but they have also found that a strong environmental component underlies mental health conditions. These environmental factors include some form of overt trauma (physical, sexual or emotional) or more subtle stressors, such as chronic stress, a family marked by poor communication, having a parent who has experienced trauma, etc.Ultimately, experts believe that the combination of genetic predisposition to mental illness and environmental stressors determine whether a mental illness develops.Unlike other areas of medicine in which a patient may be given a medication to treat an illness, like a diabetic person receiving insulin, a person with mental illness cannot be prescribed medicine that is guaranteed to work. For example, two people with very similar symptoms of depression may be prescribed the same type of anti-depressant, and one person may respond well while the other may have little or no response.This is because mental illness is different for everyone. We have names for specific illnesses (like bipolar disorder, depression, general anxiety disorder, etc.) but, unlike diabetes or other illnesses, each patient’s specific symptoms are different. Further, because the illness is not a strictly biological problem, each person may react very differently to the same medicine.What does this mean for a person with mental illness undergoing treatment? It means that psychiatry is a very inexact science, and it’s important for people seeking treatment to be aware of the challenges they may face.Two psychiatrists may observe different traits in a person with mental illness and subsequently prescribe different medications. For example, a patient may present to one psychiatrist as having major depressive disorder while another prescriber understands the same symptoms as bipolar disorder. These different diagnoses will yield very different treatment options, as the medications prescribed for the conditions are different. One medicine may be effective while another may have no positive impact, or even be harmful to the patient.One of the tragedies of treating mental illness, especially for people with serious mental illness, is that a person may be “misdiagnosed” for a very long time before receiving the correct diagnosis by a different prescriber. Self-advocacy — taking an active role in the diagnosis and treatment process — can be critical. When individuals and family members prioritize transparency and honest communication about symptoms, goals and experiences with past treatment, it may help the prescriber attain a more accurate understanding of the condition and plan for more effective treatment.Prescribing medication requires practitioners to make judgment calls. For example, there is not one medicine for bipolar disorder; there are many medicines that work for some and not for all.This means that prescribers use their own judgments based on the description of symptoms given by their patients, their training and their past experiences. Theoretically, five psychiatrists could choose five different medications to treat the same person. This is because each is using their own subjective opinion of what medication will work best. There is no guaranteed treatment with mental illness; there is ambiguity, subjectivity and, unfortunately, lots of trial and error.This is another area where self-advocacy can be critical — when a patient is able to clearly communicate what they are experiencing with their symptoms and side effects it may help the prescriber make more accurate decisions about changing the treatment plan.The most damaging outcome of ambiguity in psychiatry is when a patient does not have an accurate understanding of the process and the potential challenges. A person walking into a psychiatrist’s office for the first time, for example, may not be informed that the medicine their doctor prescribes quite possibly will not work, or if the medicine helps, it may not help enough to provide substantial relief.Without having this knowledge, the patient may start down a long and difficult path of trial and error. They may lose faith in the person prescribing the medication and, rather than seeking a second opinion, they may feel disempowered to pursue the treatment-seeking process any further.With that said, any psychiatrist or nurse practitioner should inform their patients about the inexact nature of mental illness and the subjectivity that goes into deciding on medicines to treat it — and about the importance of self-education and self-advocacy. As a therapist, I often find myself in this role even though I am not directly involved in prescribing medicine.If people are educated about how psychiatric medication works, they can understand the process and feel encouraged to keep trying, to consult with another doctor who may better understand their illness and treat it more effectively and to never give up on finding the treatment that works for them.David Steingart is an LCSW who practices in Tallahassee, Fla.

      "body": "While going through the intensive university application process, I came across an issue that I felt in my bones was not fair, nor ethical.A personal tutor asked me if they were permitted to include my mental health difficulties in my reference letter. Taken aback, and at the mercy of the process, I said yes. However, upon reflection, I felt that I was not in a position to say anything else. I needed the reference, and I could not afford to say no.This personal disclosure did not sit well with me; I felt that including my mental health history as a disclaimer in the application process amounted to forewarning universities of my struggles, and resulting poor attendance, as though it were my fault. My tutor did not want to give a reference that would “mislead a university.” Regardless of my tutor’s intentions, it still did not seem right.I found myself wondering, would the same request ever be made of a student who had a physical disability causing them to miss classes? Would a potential reference write a glowing letter to conclude with “this student is in a wheelchair, but they mean well”? I doubt it.I have complex trauma and dissociative issues, both of which significantly interfere with my ability to meet academic expectations when my symptoms are flaring. Throughout my university application process, I felt I that I was being asked to assure universities that my mental health would not get in the way of my studies.Ultimately, I felt that universities were asking the wrong question.The question should not be “what can I do to protect my university’s interests?” Rather, universities should ask “what can we do to accommodate our students?”I am a pursuing a degree in psychology, with the intention of helping others who have struggled with their mental health. In fact, many of the mental health industry’s staff and contributors have their own mental health challenges and reasons for wanting to enter this field and help others. So how can universities be so callous in dismissing people whose lived experiences interfere with their ability to pursue this education?I believe those of us with lived experience owe it to ourselves and society to challenge “ableism” in academia and lead the way in advocating for fair and equitable opportunities for all.The harmful, and even toxic, cultural issues within academia place exceedingly high standards on productivity, to the detriment to staff and students alike. Interviews with fellow psychology students highlighted how this academic culture, in which students are expected to produce high-quality work while meeting multiple deadlines, becomes harmful for people with mental illness. As a result, ableism is internalized, normalized and becomes ingrained in the culture.Despite being — at least in part — responsible for worsening students’ mental health, universities tend to focus more on what they expect from students (and enforcing the consequences of not meeting those expectations) than on how they can provide students with the right help if mental health issues arise. Furthermore, when students do seek help, this help is often limited and overstretched.At my university, support varies based on whether a person has a “medically recognized” diagnosis. Support for people without a diagnosis includes drop-in therapy sessions, self-help resources, virtual workshops, “well-being” advisors and links to community projects outside of the university, such as support group sessions. These options, however, often had waiting lists of up to six weeks.Those with medical diagnoses were entitled to a disability allowance (funded by the UK government, not universities), and personalized academic study support plans. While the support plans were designed to give students special consideration regarding assignment extension requests, lecturers were not actually obligated to adhere to the plans. These support options, in my view, do not match the desperate need for mental health support in higher education.Additionally, many individuals dealing with complex mental health issues are often left without a diagnosis for weeks, if not months, due to the long wait times to see a psychiatrist. It is my view that if universities are to make stipulations around a person’s well-being based on their diagnostic status, then universities should step-up and adequately fund measures to ensure all students can receive such diagnoses in a timely manner.Another issue with mental health services both within and outside universities are the outdated criteria for judging who is (and isn’t) deserving of support. The DSM-5 includes a caveat that disorders must create a significant disruption to everyday life. However, this is harmful as it almost sets up individuals onto a course of destruction for them to be taken seriously.By this definition, I would be deemed fit to function, and not in need of support, because I manage to accomplish what I need to. What remains overlooked is quality of life. I am certain many academics with hidden disabilities manage to scrape by and tick the “necessary boxes” to meet minimum requirements. The standards represented by education and clinical assessment would say we are functioning. But I wonder, what other choice do we have?Accessing available support is particularly complicated for people with dissociative, trauma-related and/or psychotic mental issues, as so much of the support offered is catered solely to anxiety or depression.The available “well-being” staff, I observed, seemed to lack awareness of a variety of psychiatric problems or the impacts of trauma, or wider experiences of social stigma and discrimination that many students from minority backgrounds face. Boilerplate responses to requests for help included:All in all, this picture of mental health support at universities is an uncomfortable reminder of just how poor standards are for care in higher education. Students must fight to stay afloat, fight to get support and fight to get accommodations.Students deserve better.My hope is that, one day, no one will feel obligated to divulge their health information in any kind of application. I want to see a future in which anyone with mental illness can receive an education with the support and accommodations they need. We are not a burden, and we deserve to be heard, encouraged and supported.Joel Bates is a graduate student and research assistant studying psychology and neuroscience.

      "body": "When I walked into an urgent care clinic one Sunday morning, I knew I could not afford the office visit, let alone any of the medications that might be prescribed. But I knew I needed help, and I had to try something.I was suffering from a deep, dark, debilitating episode of depression that left me unable to function or think clearly. I had been experiencing crushing symptoms of major depression since my teen years (although I hadn’t been able to identify what, exactly, was wrong at the time), but this recent episode was particularly alarming.It had already lasted several months, and I had been actively thinking of suicide as a way out, trying to talk myself out of such a final decision. I was concerned that I might take my own life. So, despite my inability to pay, I sought out care.Rather than being honest with the care provider that day, I wrote a check that exceeded what I had in my account. In the moment, I felt as though I had no other choice. Fortunately, I was able to earn some money doing odd jobs over the next few days to put into the bank before the check was cashed.While this felt necessary in the moment, I can’t say that I would recommend this approach to anyone. In fact, I would suggest being honest with providers about your financial situation if you feel comfortable doing so. If you can’t afford to pay for treatment, but you have the courage and the will to go seek help, explaining the situation to a practitioner may work to your benefit. There are those who may help, at least temporarily, to get you through an immediate crisis.However, as I would come to learn, consistent treatment for a mental health condition requires financial means.For the 15 years following my trip to the urgent care clinic, I would be on and off different antidepressant medications to find an effective treatment for my mental health conditions. During that time, I started a successful business and, as a result, I was able to pay for my treatment and carry insurance to help cover costs.However, after selling my business and weathering another episode of major depression just months later, I ended up divorced, broke and homeless. My mental health continued to deteriorate, and I, once again, had no way to pay for my treatment.The county where I lived at that time did offer low-cost mental health services. But even then, I was expected to pay a minimum charge for services. At that time $10 or $20 was more than I could afford. Even if I could finance a 30-minute therapy visit, I could not afford to pay for any medications because I had no insurance, and I would have to pay full price for medication that cost hundreds of dollars a month for an uninsured person.So, I suffered.For the next several years, I managed to survive by living at reduced rent with friends (or no rent at all with family) earning an income working as an independent consultant when I was able. I purchased medication sporadically, whenever I had the extra money. This was not a stable period in my life.Going on and off anti-depressants, I learned, is not an effect treatment plan; I was never depression-free for more than three to four months at a time because I could not afford to continue taking the medications as prescribed to me. Even when I was able to pay for medication, the financial stress added to my mental health problems because I felt that I would never be free from this barrier.Eventually, my situation changed. I was able to find a treatment that worked for me, and I could finally afford to stay with it. But I did not reach this point alone; I had the emotional and financial support of a partner.My wife and I married 12 years ago. She saw beyond my diagnosis and decided to make sure I had all the help I needed to improve my mental health. Insurance that covered mental health issues was available to me through her employer. She took me to the doctor when I didn’t want to go. She picked up my meds and made sure I took them. She learned to check up on me by asking how I “felt,” not what was “wrong” with me today. These word choices were important because we could communicate without me becoming defensive and withdrawing.She became my advocate in seeking therapies that had shown promise for a more favorable and longer-term treatment outcome. Because of new treatments and good insurance, for a decade now, I have been gainfully employed, able to cover my co-pays and able to work without taking days off and missing work due to mental health issues. Unfortunately, many people with mental illness may not be able to achieve relief and health without this kind of support from a family member or close friend.Often low cost, or no cost, options are limited (if they exist at all). This must change. Mental health care is necessary for the good of our society. It should be available to all who need it regardless of their financial status.We have a responsibility to make this happen for people who cannot afford care. Those of us who have been down this road must end the silence and share our stories. Our experience can shed light on the changes we have to make for the future.Marty Parrish is a PMI Certified Project Management Professional (PMP) and Senior IT Program Project Manager for the nation’s largest non-profit health care system.

      "body": "When you are young, society seems to hand out labels like candy on Halloween. Growing up, I was labeled “the Black kid,” “the weirdo,” “the nerd,” “the fat kid.” The world around me seemed to dole out these categories without a second thought, and I let them define me throughout my childhood.Unfortunately, the labels didn’t stop once I entered adulthood. Rather, they became centered around my worsening mental health. With each new diagnosis, which in turn, became a label, understanding and accepting myself became even more challenging.In the spring of 2012, a year after I lost my mother, I was in crisis. Between my sobs and fits of rage, I felt like nothing mattered. I was not in school; I was unable to find work and my mood was constantly swinging from over-productive to fatigued and depressed.My friends had gone off to college, and I was alone and struggling. My already-challenging circumstances, combined with this lack of social support, resulted in homelessness. Soon after, at 22 years old, I was hospitalized.I received a diagnosis during this hospitalization, which felt like being slapped with yet another label: bipolar. My mother had bipolar disorder, and despite a few incidents, she seemed essentially “normal,” so I was at least familiar with my new label. With medication and therapy, I figured, I would manage the situation.Two years later, my label changed when I was diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder. My immediate reaction was fear. I was afraid that all my efforts in getting better — the meds I had taken, the therapy I was attending, the efforts I had made to learn about my first label — were all irrelevant. Not only had my efforts been misdirected, but I also had to make sense of a new, more foreign label. I saw myself as a failure, a freak, another “crazy” person who belonged in the hospital.I was frightened to tell people the truth about my diagnosis, fearing what meaning they might ascribe to my new label. This fear came true when I eventually told someone that I had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, and they seemed to be afraid of me. After this encounter, I found that I was afraid of myself, too.I became obsessed with the “schizoaffective” label and began to isolate myself even further from the small pool of people who cared about me. Unsurprisingly, this isolation only made my mental health worse.As I obsessed over my diagnosis and how others would perceive me, I began to spiral into a pattern of negative thinking.“What if I go off the deep end?” I wondered one night.What if I became just another failed statistic? I was still taking my meds and still seeing a therapist, but what if it was all for nothing? The thought tore through my chest like an icicle to the heart. What if it never went away? What if it never became manageable? What if I never got back to “normal”?At the time, being “normal” was the ultimate goal. I wasn’t normal; my thoughts, actions, what I heard and felt weren’t like what anyone else experienced. If I could get back to being like everyone else with medication and therapy, I thought, I could be happy. “Normal” became a mythical sense of self; in this reality, I could be more than a failure — more than my diagnosis allowed, more than what people feared about me.As I committed to my therapy and fought to find the right combinations of medications, I began to accept my own version of “normal.” Over time, I was able to let go of some of my fears and the labels that once reduced me to a diagnosis.In therapy, we broke down my fears born from labeling and stigma; we acknowledged them, contextualized them and finally put them to rest. With a lot of social support from my peer-support programs, I got better friends, ones who could help me understand myself better and who didn’t judge.I wasn’t “fixed,” but I worried less about how I would be perceived as a person with mental illness. I even went back to school; I began my life again, this time with fresh, non-judgmental eyes.Recently, I had a thought. A thought that didn’t arise during panicked thinking in the middle of the night: The labels don’t matter — what matters is context. Who we are beyond our appearances, diagnoses and circumstances is far more important than the labels themselves. The choices I made and the way I live my life is far more revealing than any diagnosis.Now I choose to live my life with just one label: Cindy.Cindy Tillory studies sociology at Palomar College, and she plans to graduate in Spring 2022.

      "body": "Once again, I dusted off my outdated resume and began to write cover letters. Feeling cautiously optimistic, I applied to several companies listed on an employment site. As I returned to the job hunt, I was acutely aware that my moods could stop me from staying employed (again). However, this time, I decided to conceal that negativity in my briefcase and go for it.Throughout my adulthood, the irrationality and impulsiveness of mania has severely limited my ability to stay employed. I often describe mania as a similar feeling to chugging 20 energy drinks and weathering the side effects for days, weeks or even months. You can imagine how this would affect a person’s ability to work.Due to mania, I’ve jumped from job to job — human services to advertising, back to human services, then pursued my Master’s in Special Education that led to teaching, then lastly back to human services — never actually building a career.My emotions and symptoms often cloud my thinking and behavior, ruining my relationships at work. However, identifying my diagnosis and learning coping skills has been key to learning how to keep a job.It was nearly impossible to hold a job when I was manic because I had no idea how sick I was. My symptoms included:I blamed everyone else for my deficiencies because I was always right.My supervisors tried to rein me in, but I refused. Inevitably, they would have to let me go. Letting someone go sounds so gentle and kind — as if my bosses sent me off like a baby bird learning to fly. In reality, letting me go sounded something like:Each time, my body reacted with a combination of tears and my jaw locking up so painfully I would only be able to eat applesauce and milk shakes.After losing three jobs to my unpredictable moods, I took some time off to regroup. I spent a week in the hospital and left with a parting gift — a diagnosis of Bipolar I Disorder.Identifying my mental illness while in the psych ward, as well as receiving medications and therapies, revived both positivity and balance in my life. It took several months to feel stable enough to work again, but then I took a flexible, low-stress job.My supervisor was an excellent support system who understood mental illness because of personal experience. She was also studying to be a licensed social worker. She advocated for me on several occasions when I had to miss work due to an episode of mania or depression. She also firmly mandated that I skip the annual “all-hands-on-deck” conferences that took place around the country in order to stay home with my support team of family and professionals. I learned from her that my self-care was valid and essential to my well-being.After two years in this manageable position, bipolar disorder took control of my brain again, dragging me from mania to depression. I knew I needed to stop working, but at least this time leaving was my decision. Instead of working a job, I chose to work on myself.“Doing the work,” full-time to understand and manage my mental illness required an effort to change my habits. I began eating well, exercising, prioritizing self-care, following a medication regimen and trying progressive muscle relaxation to ground myself. I also began journaling about the things I was grateful for and even writing essays to reflect.This process had its ups and downs. Sometimes meditation and muscle relaxation calmed me down, sometimes not. My medications would work for a while — until they didn’t. Sometimes, therapy gave me perspective and sometimes I felt stuck. Despite the challenges, after learning these tools, I felt a spark of control, confidence and hope that I hadn’t felt in years.Recently, I was invited to meet with supervisors of a position I had applied for before my latest episode of mania. I aced the interview despite my internal whirlpool of emotions and landed the job. Having been out of work for more than two years, I didn’t feel ready to call myself an employee.The positive self-talk I developed during my brief recovery quickly turned negative again. I almost talked myself out of trying, but then my therapist helped me realize that my anxiety about returning to work triggered my anger and agitation. By employing some coping skills, like getting professional help, self-care, practicing gratitude and finding presence, I believe my anxiety will pass and, in turn, my manic behaviors will settle down.Despite my doubts, I am going for it. I work every day to relax, let go of negativity, diligently fill the responsibilities of my post and, when needed, seek help on and off the job.

      "body": "My 21-year-old son called me on a beautiful fall morning in 2020 to tell me about his first serious relationship.“I’m falling in love!” he declared.Many mothers dream for their children to find love, companionship and acceptance, and I am no different. What I was not prepared for was the primary reason for their breakup just four months later: My mental illness.I knew firsthand the consequences of choosing to speak out about mental health.In 2019, after publishing a memoir that detailed my mental health challenges, a fellow church member I had known for more than a year stopped looking me in the eyes. She would speak to everyone around me and act as if I wasn’t there.A new acquaintance I met at a women’s luncheon told me, after reading my book, that she didn’t know if we could be friends.A neighbor said to me, “I read your book. I have never known anyone who has a mental illness.”While these incidents were uncomfortable for me — and, unfortunately, not uncommon — the fallout from my mental health advocacy was far more damaging for my son.The girlfriend’s mother, I learned, Googled our family and discovered that I had been on a national tour of public libraries to promote mental health awareness. My daughter — my co-author — and I have been to 46 states and given more than 50 media interviews.I thought that seeing our TV interviews and hearing our story would leave a good impression because my family had pulled together to help me overcome my mental health challenges. We were sharing a message of hope to those suffering. I was proud of the mental health advocacy work we had done.This was not the case.“They don’t like me,” my son told me.His girlfriend’s parents had never met him. They warned their daughter to call her immediately if my son did something “psycho.”It didn’t matter that my son was in the college honors society, Phi Beta Kappa, an active participant in student associations or that the couple seemed very happy together.My son tried to win his girlfriend’s parents over. He loved their daughter, a bright, vivacious and lovely woman. But when he went to dinner to meet her parents for the first time, her father ignored him, and her mother asked him if he had Tourette Syndrome (a condition of the nervous system he does not have) when he rolled his neck at the table.My son’s girlfriend eventually revealed that her parents, who had just read my memoir, were pressuring her to end the relationship. My mental health struggles — not my son’s — were the deal breaker.In my book, I share that after my attempted suicide, doctors said I was in no shape to be a mother.At 16, my son moved to Utah to live with my husband’s brother to finish high school. My son informed me that while in high school, people would ask him why he didn’t live with his parents.“My mother got sick,” was his answer.Most assumed I had cancer. My son never denied or confirmed this information; he wanted to keep my suicide attempt and our family mental health struggles private because of the stigma. Unfortunately, he would later suffer the consequences of stigma from the woman he loved.Now, he wonders if anyone will love, accept and consider marrying him. It’s been seven months since his break-up, and he is still afraid that potential partners and their families may read my life story and make similar judgements. I understand completely.It is no surprise that people with mental illness and their families stay silent.People with mental health challenges are at an increased risk for being discriminated against and stereotyped. This affects public figures (like Britney Spears, whose struggles are public domain in her recent court hearings) and many families who are not in the limelight.I worry the more open and transparent I am about my mental health journey, the more my family may have to deal with the consequences. However, I know that the way to break the ever-present, damaging stigma is for those of us with lived experience to be open and transparent about our mental health struggles.So, I continue to speak out about my story. And I tell my son that a loving partner — as I have in my own husband — is someone who loves you for you; someone who won’t let stigma get in the way of loving you. That is true love.Sonja Wasden is a mental health advocate, keynote speaker and co-author of “An Impossible Life,” which was featured on CBS This Morning as a story of hope for those living with mental illnesses.

      "body": "As a church-going health care worker who has fought her own battle with mental illness, I’ve always been frustrated by one message I consistently heard in church: Mental illness makes you “a bad Christian.”Growing up in a gospel church in southern Louisiana — and even attending a nondenominational protestant church as an adult living in North Dakota — I internalized harmful messages that inspired fear rather than encouraging help or healing. In sermons, books by Christian leaders and private conversations with preachers and churchgoers, I would often hear the following statements:Accusations like these, as you might expect, have the power to shame and derail anyone living with mental illness and hinder them from seeking necessary care.When it came to physical illness, faith leaders at my church encouraged us to see cardiologists, obstetricians and oncologists, as maintaining physical health allowed us to be “good and faithful Christian soldiers.” We were taught that God is the “great surgeon” and “ultimate healer,” and He can work through health care providers.However, His power to heal through others seemed to stop at therapists or psychiatric medications. Instead, mental illnesses were treated as a spiritual and moral failure that could be fixed through prayer and repentance.When I was battling depression as a teenager, a preacher even attempted to “cast out” my “demons.” He pressed his hand pressed on my forehead and said, “I command the demons to come out, in Jesus’ name!” I truly believe the preacher had the best of intentions, but the event left me feeling like I was a bad person, equivalent to a demon, and so weak that I would allow demons to live inside me. I cried myself to sleep that night.My guilt intensified when my church passed out booklets to help teens fight what it deemed to be “demons” of adolescence: Alcohol, drugs, sex and depression. The booklet advised that we simply “walk away” from the demons.In my early 20s, I tried again. I had an individualized prayer session where I was instructed to scream at the demon of depression and to stomp on an invisible dark cloud that was beneath me. I thought the exercise was therapeutic at the time. But when the depression inevitably returned, I felt guilty that I hadn’t done the session right or believed enough.Desperate for resolution, I researched Christian-based health insurance to help with my mental health care. But the Christian-affiliated insurance companies I looked into were resolute in their opposition to covering antidepressants, as these medications were “not biblical.”I believed my home church in North Dakota could be a support system for me later in my mental health journey. After recovering from a period of intense suicidal ideation following a serious physical injury, I credited much of my progress to my faith and involvement in church. The combination of effective health care, Bible study group and social connection had grounded me and bolstered my recovery.Ultimately, I also hoped that my story of using faith and fellowship to improve my mental health could be an excellent part of my testimony and reach others who might have turned to the church for help. My church, however, felt differently.Despite my involvement in my faith community — as a successful participant in prayer groups, children’s church and community outreach — I was not permitted to volunteer in a church youth group because I disclosed my past struggles with suicidal ideation. At the time, my primary goals were to help lead my daughter to salvation, and to be there for youth that were struggling as I once had. I also believed that volunteering in this capacity would be beneficial for my mental health.The youth pastor dismissed my concerns, telling me to keep working on myself, and that I could be “interviewed” again in a year. The message felt clear: Your desire to participate in the church is of less importance than our belief that your mental illness is a threat to our church.Ultimately, this rejection hindered my recovery by making me feel “less than” and untrustworthy. Moreover, it damaged my relationship with Jesus Christ and my involvement with the church. I was angry and hurt, but not just for my own sake. As a nurse in a mental health care facility, I thought about my patients, and how they would be treated in this environment.While the rejection by my church was a painful experience, I still returned to my faith to guide me. As I have navigated my recovery, I have embraced two principles:After hearing a pastor tell a Bible study group that depression “wasn’t real,” I began a conversation about receiving mental health treatment. Most of the people in the room admitted to not only being on some type of psychiatric medication, but that they were grateful for the difference medication made in their lives. These conversations are invaluable; it shouldn’t be a dark secret that many of us seek necessary help.Ultimately, I hope my story can help people who are struggling with their faith and community when battling a mental illness. I hope my peers won’t allow fears of “not being a good Christian” to hinder them from seeking counseling or medication.The brain is complex, and sometimes there are misfires and imbalances just as there may be clots in blood vessels or weakness in the alveoli of the lungs. I believe that God made all these intricate parts of us, and He not only wants us to take care of ourselves, but He gives us ways to seek help.Ginger Robertson has been living with depression since childhood.

      "body": "When you have mental illness, you’re more than likely to encounter some form of discrimination, from social stigma and exclusion to a lack of legal protections. Thankfully, as the mental health community raises awareness and challenges stigma, the larger conversation is beginning to address the discrimination that people with mental illness experience.There is one form of discrimination, however, that rarely makes the conversation: A form of medical discrimination called “diagnostic overshadowing.”Diagnostic overshadowing, as defined by the experts, is a “process by which physical symptoms are misattributed to mental illness.” While research and personal accounts from patients suggest that there is a connection between mental and physical health, the assumption that two are always related, and that physical symptoms must be psychosomatic, is a dangerous approach.Research shows that people with mental illness die prematurely and have significantly higher medical co-morbidity, as compared to the general population. Unsurprisingly to those of us with mental health conditions, diagnostic overshadowing is believed to be one of the factors contributing to this phenomenon.My own experience seeking medical care with multiple mental illness diagnoses, including borderline personality disorder (BPD), has underscored the negative consequences of diagnostic overshadowing. Simply having psychotropic medications listed on my medical chart is enough to trigger doctors’ suspicion about my credibility as a patient.In 2015, I began having episodes of crushing chest pain. After emergency room doctors ruled out a heart attack, I followed up with a cardiologist from the medical group where my primary care physician worked.I had only been in the exam room for five minutes before he told me that my chest pain was due to anxiety. I walked out of his office in tears. I knew this pain was not anxiety; I’d experienced anxiety and debilitating panic attacks before, and this pain was much worse.I vowed to get a second opinion, so I found a cardiologist who oversaw a women’s medical center associated with a major hospital in New York City. She asked questions the other cardiologist didn’t bother to ask. She was interested in the fact that I was over 40 years old and that I had been diagnosed with both migraines and Raynaud’s Syndrome.This doctor ultimately diagnosed me with Prinzmetal’s Angina, an uncommon form of the decreased blood flow to the heart. She prescribed me a calcium channel blocker, and the frequency and severity of the attacks dropped significantly.I called my primary care physician to inform her I’d sought a second opinion for my chest pain. I told her that the chest pain was not due to anxiety, but rather a result of Prinzmetal’s Angina. She said simply, “Thank you for letting me know.”I don’t know what I expected, but I felt disappointed by her response.In 2017, I began feeling frequently nauseated and experiencing stomach pain. A gastroenterologist told me I had functional abdominal pain syndrome (FAPS), and I would simply have to “learn to live with it.”When I went home and googled this disorder, I came across a paper on the syndrome which described the condition as a “somatization disorder.” In other words, my mental and emotional state was leading to the pain I was experiencing. I was simultaneously furious about it and resigned to being dismissed by medical professionals.I lived with the pain and nausea for months, and I began unintentionally losing weight, which then triggered my anorexia. I hadn’t restricted my food intake since 2012, and I started to enjoy the feeling of seeing the numbers on the scale drop when I weighed myself.Eventually, I sought a female gastroenterologist at the women’s medical center where I’d had success with the cardiologist. She took me seriously, and put me through a series of tests, including an endoscopy, but they were all negative. I continued to lose weight and dropped almost 20 pounds in just a few months. Finally, the GI administered a breath test and it determined I had small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.I sent a message to the doctor who originally dismissed my symptoms as psychosomatic, and he wrote back, “Thanks for letting me know.”I swallowed my anger, convinced that this ordeal could have been avoided if he had taken me seriously when I first saw him. It took me over a year to gain the weight back and even longer to confront the emotional toll of having my eating disorder triggered.I still take medications for my mental illness diagnosis (two antidepressants and a second-generation antipsychotic, that works as an adjunct to my antidepressants). However, I sometimes find myself tempted to leave them off the list of medications I provide to practitioners. I worry about how disclosing my medication regimen may influence the way a doctor views me. I almost never reveal I have BPD because of the stigma associated with that diagnosis.While this experience is frustrating, there is hope. Eventually, I found compassionate doctors who saw me as a whole person and patient — doctors who could treat me effectively. I currently see a headache specialist for severe and chronic migraines. She is caring and smart (she has a Ph.D. as well as an M.D.) and she’s board certified in neurology and psychiatry.After seeing her for about five years, I felt comfortable enough to reveal that, in addition to anorexia and depression, I’d also been diagnosed with BPD.She didn’t hesitate. “You are awesome.”Andrea Rosenhaft is a licensed clinical social worker in the New York City area.

      "body": "Nowadays, people tell me I have a high degree of self-awareness and insight into my mental health. However, this was not always the case. For many years, as I battled schizoaffective disorder, I had no idea I was experiencing delusions, hallucinations and paranoia.I would spend hours and whole afternoons exploring my “inner life” — a behavior I understood as introspection. I did not realize that I was actually spending hours ruminating and engaging in my psychosis.My psychotic thoughts shrouded me in a safe oblivion, which others unintentionally encouraged through their silence. I believe it was this lack of confrontation from others that prevented me from recognizing my truth for so long. Ultimately, that lack of insight (also called Anosognosia) into the severity of my condition was a huge barrier to receiving adequate treatment.At 17, I began hearing and seeing things and that no one else heard or saw. To make matters worse, I spent significant time talking to a relative, who most likely had schizophrenia as well, about our delusions and hallucinations. She would take me driving, and we would disappear from my house for hours. To my family’s knowledge, I was just spending time with my beloved relative. Little did they know, she was convincing me that I was simply special and steering me away from recognizing I might have had a mental health condition.During this time, I began withdrawing from my peers, and my social life diminished drastically. I wandered aimlessly among my own thoughts, left to my own devices for long hours in my room. I would cry, listening to the same depressing song on repeat, engaging in suicidal ideation.The isolation was a two-way street: The people around me withdrew as well, likely in response to my sudden, drastic behavioral changes. I cut off all my hair. I stopped grooming myself completely. I was under the impression that my actions, which I now know were based on delusions, were positive, “cool” measures. I told myself it was cool to not look like myself.In the process, I lost my connection to my gender, to which I now experience so intimately as a cisgender woman. I became totally detached from what made me myself. While I was always a girly girl growing up and cared a lot about my grades, I rejected those things during this period.At the time, I felt that this behavior was simply an expression of my individuality. But the truth was, any feeling of connection to myself made me feel too raw and vulnerable.My psychiatrist during my teenage years prescribed me an antipsychotic when I was 17; however, he did not tell me exactly why I needed it.During the five years that I was on this medication, I developed twitching muscle spasms and gained a significant amount of weight. However, I was hardly aware of what was going on with my body. I didn’t connect the dots until I had my first boyfriend in college, who made me aware of the severe side effects associated with the antipsychotic I was taking. Since he had not known me before I was taking my medications, he assumed I didn’t need them. He urged me to go off my medication, and I agreed, since I didn’t even know why I was on the medication to begin with.Soon after, I started talking to him and my family about how I was in communication with aliens. I posted alarming statements online. I was told I was manic. I was told I needed help. But I still struggled to internalize that I had a problem. That is, until I finally got the help I needed from a new psychiatrist when I was 23.The new practitioner diagnosed me with schizoaffective disorder. He spoke to me like I was in control of my illness and my fate. Even though I was reluctant to go back on an antipsychotic medication, he walked me through my options and the risks involved with each one. Over time, he made sure I understood I was experiencing psychosis and that, left untreated, I could be a danger to myself and others. I agreed, and I have taken an antipsychotic ever since.I was unlucky in some ways; the conversation I needed to have about my illness didn’t take place until 10 years after I first sought mental health treatment and five years after I started experiencing symptoms of the disorder. I was left in the dark, suffering in oblivion. During that time, no one who had the appropriate perspective gave me a chance to gain an understanding of how my illness affected me. Many people in my life, it seems, were afraid to tell me I had a problem (or they were confused about what the problem really was), leaving me powerless to help myself.However, I still consider myself lucky. I am grateful that my child psychiatrist prescribed me an antipsychotic as a mood stabilizer — that turned out to be early treatment for my psychosis, which is key to success and recovery.I was also lucky to find a psychiatrist who helped me gain the insight I needed. I know from my own family history (and from working with people with mental illness) that there are mental health professionals who believe people with psychosis do not have the capability to be self-aware. I am grateful to have found a psychiatrist who believed otherwise and made such a big difference in my life.My life has been so much better since I received the appropriate treatment and started the path toward recovery and stability. I am now attending graduate school. I have worked for several reputable organizations. I live on my own (with two dogs). I’ve written articles for a number of publications about my journey, and I am a presenter for NAMI Ending the Silence and NAMI In Our Own Voice.Now, I lead an intellectually rich life in my studies and in my career — all because someone took the time to tell me the truth and give me a chance. If it were not for that chance, I might have struggled with lack of insight into my symptoms, and therefore, inadequate treatment, forever.I hope we all give people with mental illness the chance to recognize that they need help and, in turn, give them the opportunity to find the best possible care for them.Sarah Myers is currently finishing her Master’s degree in behavioral neuroscience.

      "body": "Nearly everyone who lives with mental illness has encountered barriers in their recovery journeys. For me, many of these barriers were cultural: I faced social, linguistic, religious and even political challenges as I grew up and attempted to seek treatment and support for my mental health.Being a gay, Latina woman who grew up in a religious household of immigrants, I had to overcome many obstacles in order to get the help that I needed.I began to experience symptoms of mental illness when I was in middle school. I recall feeling an unrelenting sadness, unworthiness and emptiness. A part of me knew this was not normal, but I never spoke up.In my household, we did not share our feelings. We all lived with the understanding that if people were sad or anxious, they would simply “live through it,” because that was life. Early on, my parents instilled in me the belief that God gave us life and others “had it worse” than we did, so we had no reason to complain.I did not question this notion, and I felt selfish for wanting help and relief from my pain. However, I noticed that family members seemed to cope with their struggles by drinking alcohol (perhaps to numb themselves to pain), so I knew I wasn’t the only one who was feeling this way.Beyond cultural values surrounding faith and resilience, my family simply did not have time to prioritize our mental health. We were immigrants in this country, and our immediate survival took priority over dwelling on our feelings. My family needed to focus on working so that they could provide a roof over our heads and put food on the table — all while trying their best to change our immigration status.I needed to focus on earning straight As in school, as academic achievement was the only way I would be able to obtain a college education in the future. I also needed to focus on helping my family assimilate to an unfamiliar country, often interpreting for them and filling out paperwork they did not understand.Ultimately, I knew we were all going through so much, and I did not want to burden my family with my issues. So, to cope with my feelings, I began self-harming and self-medicating.It was not until I was a freshman in high school that I attended therapy. At age 16, I fell in love with my best friend, and I came out to my family as bisexual. Because of my family’s conservative cultural upbringings and religious beliefs, my parents had adopted homophobic ideas and believed that queer sexual orientations were “going against God’s plan.” They believed that therapy would help me move past this “phase” and change me back to “normal.”Despite attending therapy for my family’s misguided agenda, I used the experience to focus on my mental health, since I knew I was not sick for being in love with another woman. I even tried involving my family in my therapy sessions, but we ran into significant language barriers.During sessions, I would have to translate for both my therapist and my family, so I never felt that the conversations were effective. Rather than my therapist acting as the bridge between my family and I, I was left to navigate the divide and explain myself in two languages.Ultimately, I did not feel that my therapist could offer an unbiased perspective, and I did not feel understood or advocated for. As a result, I did not have much hope for my recovery.On top of encountering these already-significant barriers to effective care, I faced a serious political and financial barrier: I did not have insurance because of my undocumented status. I would attend therapy only once a month because I could not afford regular sessions. This meant that my treatment was not always active, and I had to cope on my own. I tried to take away as much as I could from each therapy session because I never knew if I would return.Additionally, I did not have access to prescribing doctors and medication — which, in retrospect, I needed for symptom management. I tried applying multiple times for health insurance, and I would get rejected consistently, even as a resident. I lived in this uncertain cycle for several years before I was finally able to get insurance.Once insured, I began to attend therapy more frequently and started a medication regimen. These changes have made a profound difference in my health.Having faced what I did, I am very grateful to be where I am today. I have been attending therapy for years, and I take medication regularly. I am in a better place than I was in my childhood, and I’m proud to share my story. I advocate for myself and others while trying to make broader changes in my community.I’ve even begun pushing my family and others to break the toxic cycles that were born from generational traumas and cultural myths. With the help of NAMI and NAMI NJ en Español, I have been able to better communicate with my family. They have taken NAMI’s Family-to-Family course and educated themselves on mental health.Although they still struggle to understand my conditions, they have become more supportive. They have been there with me through the ups and downs, and they have learned to accept that I am choosing to recover in the ways that work for me — even if those ways may be different from their desired approach. Witnessing and facilitating this progress has contributed significantly to my mental health recovery.They are learning from their mistakes and slowly letting go of stigma — that seeking help is not for the weak; rather, it is for the brave.Roselin F.

      "body": "Note: This article was originally published in the Spring 2021 Advocate as “988: An Opportunity to Change Crisis Response.”A mental health crisis should not end in tragedy or trauma. In January, 52-year-old Patrick Warren, Sr. was shot by police during a mental health check. In February, police in Rochester, N.Y., handcuffed and pepper-sprayed a 9-year-old girl experiencing a mental health crisis. Last September, police in Salt Lake City shot and wounded a 13-year-old boy with autism spectrum disorder after his mother called 911 for help, saying he was having a “mental breakdown.”No matter how many times we hear about a person in a mental health crisis being hurt or killed in an encounter with law enforcement, we feel shocked and horrified. The victims and their families might not have known about NAMI, but they are part of our “family” of everyone affected by mental illness.The grief of these avoidable tragedies is even more poignant because there is a simple solution: providing a mental health response to mental health crises.We need to demand that people experiencing mental health, substance use and suicidal crises are:Last year, we took a significant step in a positive direction with the enactment of the National Suicide Hotline Designation Act, establishing 988 as a nationwide number for suicide prevention and mental health crises, which will be available across the country by July 2022. The calls will be routed through the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline to local crisis call centers.The act also declared that states may impose a fee on phone bills to support and fund crisis call center staffing and crisis outreach and stabilization services. This reflects the growing understanding that an effective crisis system should have at least three basic components: crisis call center hubs, mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization services.Crisis centers should serve as central hubs and be staffed at levels to answer calls quickly, including by text and chat. Staff should be well-trained and experienced in responding to a wide range of mental health, substance use and suicidal crises.Crisis call centers should be able to connect people to services, including dispatching mobile crisis teams. Some states are already doing this, such as Georgia with its statewide Crisis & Access Line, through which experienced clinicians can provide crisis counseling and conduct mental health assessments with callers. They can book urgent outpatient mental health appointments and are able to dispatch mobile crisis teams when needed. This capacity is a model of what should be available everywhere.Some programs estimate that about 1 in 10 behavioral health crisis calls will require the dispatch of a mobile crisis team to provide on-site de-escalation and connection to crisis stabilization or other services. Communities are increasingly looking at having mobile crisis teams staffed by mental health professionals, including peers. In several states, successful mental health mobile crisis team models rely on law enforcement for support in less than 5% of their calls.Connecticut and other states also have networks of children’s mobile crisis teams. As the tragic police responses in Rochester and Salt Lake City demonstrated, specialized children’s mobile crisis teams are desperately needed across the country.The new standard in mental health crisis response is recovery-focused, trauma-informed, “living room-like” programs that provide short-term observation and stabilization. This also includes a “warm hand-off” to follow-up care, whether it is peer supports and outpatient services, or more intensive services like hospitalization or crisis residential care.In states like Arizona, crisis stabilization includes a commitment to integrating peer supports and engaging families, addressing co-occurring substance use (they do not turn down people who are intoxicated or high), medical conditions and developmental disabilities, and nurturing a culture of hope and safety. They also work to coordinate with primary care, justice, housing, child welfare, intellectual and developmental disabilities supports, elder affairs and other services. Finally, they have a “no wrong door” approach that allows public safety officers to drop someone off and leave within minutes.When my son experienced a psychotic episode a few years ago, a friend called a mental health crisis line for me. Thankfully, the crisis line dispatched a mobile crisis team that included CIT-trained police officers, but they took a back seat to the mental health clinicians, who quickly established a rapport with my son. The lead clinician assessed the situation, calmly approached my son and said, “I’m hearing you haven’t slept for days and things are getting kind of intense. I’ll bet you’d really like to get a good night’s sleep. Do I have that right?”My son replied, “Yeah, my head hurts, and I just want to sleep, but I can’t.” The clinician said, “I know a doctor who will definitely be able to help you get to sleep and help your head stop hurting, if you’re willing to go with me to the hospital. Does that sound okay to you?” Remarkably, my son said, “Yeah, I’ll go. I want my head to stop hurting.”The next step in his journey was a crisis stabilization unit, which, after 23 hours, moved him into a psychiatric inpatient unit because he was still delusional and paranoid.While I cannot say the hospitalization and the rest of his journey went well, the immediate crisis response did. This is what we want across the country, because under different circumstances, my son could easily have ended up in jail or, worse, shot and killed.Imagine if Patrick Warren, Sr., Walter Wallace, Jr., the young girl in Rochester, or the young boy in Salt Lake City had this kind of response when they were in distress. Imagine if this type of 988 crisis response system had been there when someone you love needed it.It doesn’t have to be a faint hope; together, we can make this a reality. And there is a role for everyone in the NAMI Alliance.To realize this vision of a 988 crisis response system, state legislatures should enact user fees on phone bills, similar to existing fees that support 911 police, fire and ambulance dispatch. As the 988 act outlined, these fees can be used to develop and maintain the capacity of crisis call centers and to help support services, such as mobile crisis teams and crisis stabilization services, with a stable source of revenue that can supplement other funding, like Medicaid and state general funds.Our NAMI State Organizations and Affiliates can play an important role by:NAMI members have a unique opportunity to speak up and demand a mental health response to mental health crises. (See below for ways you can help.)After decades of advocacy, we are at a turning point. There is growing recognition of the inherent injustice of a law enforcement response to mental health crises and, importantly, there are real vehicles for change to provide the compassionate response people with mental illness deserve.Angela Kimball is National Director, Advocacy and Public Policy at NAMIYour story about the care you received during a crisis call can help NAMI share real-life experiences that illustrate how crisis services can hurt or help.

      "body": "I was 13 years old the first time my doctor told me I was close to dying. My eating disorder had only developed six months prior, but the constant restricting, bingeing and purging had led to significant heart problems caused by electrolyte imbalances.It was after this experience that my family and I realized how much I desperately needed help. However, it soon became clear just how difficult it would be to access the help I needed, as we lived in a rural area with an inadequate mental health care system.In 2011, Montana, my home state, offered no specialized treatment for severe eating disorders. My best option was to see a therapist specializing in substance use — a therapist who was not trauma-informed, LGBTQIA+ friendly or knowledgeable about eating disorders. They advised me to simply “drink more milk” and even suggested that I was weak or trying to punish my parents with my eating disorder. I was shocked by how inadequate the care was.Unsurprisingly, I only continued to get sicker until it was clear I needed a much higher level of care. After weeks of fighting with insurance, my mother eventually found me an inpatient treatment center out of state, where I could receive six weeks of intensive treatment.I suffered from a severe eating disorder until I was 23 years old, and in that time, I went to treatment eight separate times. My admissions into treatment centers were only covered by insurance once I was hospitalized, so each step forward presented a new financial strain.Even then, it was a battle to find a treatment center out of state that would accept my insurance. Often, insurance companies either refuse to cover any treatment, or they cut coverage too soon. The magnitude of the stress and heartache this caused my family cannot be captured in words. They felt helpless and eventually started mourning my death because it seemed impossible to find care that could help me.Access to care, my family quickly learned, is about as complex as eating disorders are. I was incredibly fortunate to find a treatment center while so many others don’t even get this baseline of care. However, there is a difference between access to a treatment center and access to comprehensive, adequate care. Admission to a mental health facility does not mean the care you are receiving is even close to adequate, and it often does not address the root cause of mental illness.Eventually, after an extensive search, I was able to find a therapist skilled in the complexity of eating disorders and a facility with a team of compassionate providers that understood that healing and wellness involve time.Even though I eventually found a facility and a therapist, my recovery was a decade-long battle that, I believe, would have been very different had I been able to access care close to home. Local, effective care would have allowed me to receive treatment for the duration it takes to unravel the complexities of an eating disorder. Additionally, my family would have been able to participate more fully in my care, without the stress of navigating insurance “rules” or using vacation and sick leave to attend sessions states away so that insurance would continue to pay. This, unfortunately, was not our experience.This is a pain that no family should ever have to go through. Things desperately need to change in our mental health care system so people can get the help they need where they live. Families and individuals battling mental illness should be able to focus on their healing, not constantly fighting bureaucracy and worrying about how they can access crucial treatment.It is my hope that providers, legislators and insurance companies take action to make treatment for mental health conditions more accessible. Perhaps these steps could include having resources available that are income-based and more geographically and financially accessible.Other critical measures include ensuring that practitioners receive culturally proficient and trauma-informed training and providers acknowledge the barriers that exist for rural and marginalized communities. Access to comprehensive mental health care is a right that should be available to everyone. Within the current system, the strain of lacking resources and insufficient care compound the hardship people with mental illness face.I was fortunate to receive the care I needed (eventually), but not everyone is as lucky. Where you live should not determine your access to healing.Maggie Hammond lives in Bozeman, Mont., where she is finishing up her college degree and working at a local wellness clinic.

      "body": "Accepting a diagnosis is one of the most difficult experiences for people living with mental illness (as well as their caregivers). It certainly was for me and my spouse. I refused to come to terms with my diagnosis for six years. It took an involuntary hospitalization to start treatment, another 10 years to fully embrace treatment and two additional years to reach recovery.Unfortunately, my experience is common. People living with mental illness often ignore, minimize, dismiss or refuse to accept their diagnoses, largely due to stigma surrounding mental health conditions. This can lead to delaying treatment, as it did for me. Unsurprisingly, then, the average time between symptom onset and treatment is 11 years. This delay can make a condition worse and harder to treat.There are several things that caregivers and providers can do to reduce stigma and help people with mental illness accept their diagnoses and the treatment they need.Use Empathy and Compassion\nA health care provider is usually the first person to deliver a diagnosis. Sometimes they may do so quickly, or even insensitively, considering how shocking and discomforting this news can be. Many studies show that health care providers may stigmatize their patients, including expressing negative attitudes while discussing the prognosis of a person’s condition.A patient is more likely to accept a diagnosis if you deliver it empathetically. For example, you can reach a more positive outcome by telling them that, while it might seem scary, you will work with them to reduce symptoms and improve their quality of life.Give Hopeful Messages\nStigma may contribute to the view that serious mental illness (SMI) is “a death sentence.” Naturally, this can be crushing to a patient. So, while it’s important to give a realistic prognosis, you should also make sure to offer hope to a patient. You can do this by telling patients that recovery is possible. Providing relatable examples of people living with SMI can also provide significant hope.Combat Societal Stigma\nOne of the best ways you can help your patients accept a diagnosis is by working to counter the stigma that patients may have internalized. You can do this by dispelling myths, providing the patient with facts and facilitating their mental health education.Normalize Mental Illness\nYou should let your patients know that 21% of people live with mental illness. For people with SMI, it can be more effective to state the numbers rather than percentages. For example, more than 13 million people (rather than 5.2%) experience serious mental illness each year.Use Empathy and Compassion\nCaregivers should focus on the person they’re caring for (not the illness) and avoid using stigmatizing statements. You can help by letting your loved one know that they are cherished, that the relationship has not changed and that you will always be there for support.It is also important to understand the emotional distress that a diagnosis may cause and to be patient with a loved one’s journey to accept the new reality — coming to terms with a diagnosis can take time.Accept the Diagnosis\nCaregivers may also have a difficult time accepting a diagnosis. If this is the case, you should avoid making hurtful statements to your loved ones like “I had so many dreams for you...” This can be extremely harmful to a loved one and make them feel like a disappointment to their family.It can be helpful to learn more about a loved one’s condition and to speak with someone who has also experienced a mental illness. Of course, a health care provider can also be a valuable resource.Do Not Force Treatment\nCaregivers may, and should, encourage their loved one to seek treatment — but the decision is ultimately up to the person with mental illness. Threatening to force treatment may cause a loved one to become angry and can significantly strain the relationship. If the person needing treatment withdraws and isolates, it may be more difficult to help them.When a person makes their own decision to seek treatment and feels they are in control, they are more likely to be adherent to treatment recommendations.Recognize Lack of Insight\nLack of insight is a condition where a person refuses to accept that they are sick. This is not a conscious decision, but rather a symptom of mental illness that causes a person to be unable to perceive their condition accurately. If you are concerned that your loved one may be experiencing this, you should consult a professional. There is a communication approach that many caregivers find helpful, called LEAP, which stands for listen, empathize, agree and partner.Give Support\nIt’s essential for caregivers to offer support to their loved one (without smothering them). The first step is learning the best way to talk to a loved one and asking them what does and doesn’t help. Understanding self-stigma can also provide an extremely helpful perspective in what negative perceptions prevent them from accepting their diagnoses.Prepare for a Crisis\nNo family wants to think of a crisis, such as a hospitalization or an arrest. But unfortunately, this does happen to many people with mental illness. It’s essential to know your crisis response options and come up with a crisis plan with your loved one while they are well enough to make decisions.It can be extremely heartbreaking for a caregiver to watch their loved one refuse their diagnosis and treatment. I deeply regret my refusal to accept my diagnosis and treatment sooner. I often share this message with people I meet who are struggling.I think things would have been much different for me if I had heard the life-saving, hopeful message that recovery is possible, especially from my previous health care providers. I wish I had not stayed with these practitioners for so long, knowing that they did not have hope for me. In many cases, providers and caregivers sharing the message of hope is the most effective way to help someone one accept their diagnosis and treatment. Acceptance starts with hope.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "An estimated 20,000 research studies have been done on the impact of stress on the human body. According to the medical experts, no one study definitively proves that unresolved childhood stress and trauma can cause physical illness. However, my personal experience has led me to believe that it does.I am not a medical professional, nor am I a therapist or nurse. What I am is a professional patient who has battled a lifetime of illnesses, from Type 1 diabetes and high blood pressure to Graves’ disease and stage IV colon cancer (twice).I believe my complex medical history is connected to the sexual abuse I experienced in my childhood. Exploring this connection has been a key component of learning how to heal from trauma.Typically, one of the first lessons children learn is the importance of telling the truth. For children who have experienced physical, emotional, spiritual or psychological trauma, this lesson becomes confusing and stressful. Frequently threatened and told to lie, children like me are led further and further away from a core value: The authenticity to speak directly from the soul.The result is often a spiritual loss so deep that recovery from stress and trauma can feel impossible.Late one night, during a hospital stay for surgery to remove two feet of my colon, I knew I was dying. It was in that moment that I vowed, if I woke up the next morning, I would teach my body, mind and spirit how to heal.My journey to healing required an emotional reset. I had physically survived the trauma, but my emotional wounds remained. I was always sad, hurt and angry because of the years of emotional issues and suffering I endured. I wanted a person to blame and hold responsible for my pain. I wanted the individuals responsible for the abuse to apologize; but I learned amends rarely happen.The healing journey is also complicated by the constant reinforcement of victim-blaming attitudes (by peers, courts and media) that validate what perpetrators have been saying all along — that the abuse was the victim’s fault. Part of my process involved learning and accepting that abuse is neither the victim’s fault nor their responsibility; responsibility lies solely with the perpetrator.For years after being abused as a child and sexually exploited by a therapist, I carried around the feeling that I was at fault for these traumatic events because I was not smart enough to know better. In a new therapy group, I was shocked to learn that none of these traumas were my responsibility.Healing started the moment I took back the ability to speak directly from my soul. I also found many other ways to cope and heal:I continued my healing by writing several books, including: “Never Give Up: Break the Connection Between Stress and Illness,” which won a 2018 Living Now Gold Book Award for books that change people’s lives. Additionally, I reported my abuse to the authorities as a way to take my power back.As I have written in my book, I have come to believe that when people think they are responsible for emotional trauma, this false belief disturbs the mind, body and spirit — potentially weakening their immune system and leading to stress headaches and muscle tension, depression and fatigue.Sometimes I worry that the self-blame and negative self-talk following my abuse was actually more harmful to me than the abuse itself. As I blamed myself and took responsibility for my abuse, I found myself in hospitals for illness after illness.As I look back from an emotionally healed place, I have a message to share: It is our birthright to heal from the abuse we did not ask for or want, and to become the physically healthy person we always wanted to be.Alexis Acker-Halbur is an award-winning author and an abuse survivor.

      "body": "“I can’t take this anymore.”Many of us who care for someone with a mental illness have heard these words before. We’ve watched friends and family members battle the pain and challenges, and we’ve worried for their safety when they say some days feel too overwhelming.This leaves many of us to wonder: What should we do when someone we care about says they wish they were gone? What do we do if we suspect they are thinking of harming themselves?Ask them how they are — what they are thinking and how they are feeling. Asking someone if they are suicidal won’t put the idea in their head or encourage them to go through with it. Checking in and asking will likely make talking about a difficult subject easier and lessen some of the shame and guilt they might be feeling.When you ask from a place of genuine care and concern, you create a powerful emotional bond that helps bring someone who is struggling out of isolation and darkness and back to a place of feeling connected to others.These questions can include:If their answer to the last two questions is “yes,” here are some important follow-up questions:If they answer “yes” to any of these, it’s important to get more information. Previous attempts make future attempts more likely, and planning or acquiring the means for self-harm are signs that they may be actively suicidal.Important follow-up questions include:Their answers to these questions are key to determining what support they may need. For example, if the answer to the first question is “loneliness” and the answer to the second question is “connection,” it can give you a clear picture of how to help and support them.Next, you’ll want to ask about sources of emotional support. If they don’t have appropriate emotional support, you’ll want to ensure that they can find help. Don’t promise to keep their feelings and plans secret. A better response is to offer to work with them as best you can; however, their long-term health and safety is the priority.You’ll want to ask about:Your friend or family member may be experiencing deep pain. Rather than trying to lighten the situation, try to listen and understand what life is like for them in this moment. What is their pain? What are their fears?Remember, when having these conversations, the focus should not be solving their problem or “fixing” them. Instead, your goal is to truly hear and understand them. Depression often convinces people that nobody understands them, loves them or wants to be around them. Depression can trick a person into believing their friends would rather not be bothered. They may be caught in this web and pull away or isolate themselves from a support system.Here are some key steps to being an active listener.Communicate a Non-Judgmental and Accepting Attitude\nListen without making judgments. See the situation through the other person’s eyes. One of the most basic emotional needs of human beings is to be heard and feel important. Validation is essential.Validation can include statements like:Show You Are Paying Attention\nMake eye contact; maintaining connection conveys caring.You can communicate your attention by:Clarify Through Restating and Summarizing\nGive a short summary to show you heard and understood what they have told you. This gives them a chance to correct you and keep the conversation on track. Even better, this helps them hear themselves; allowing them to think about what they’re saying and feeling.Try saying:Respect the Pace and the Flow of the Conversation\nAllow your loved one time to finish their thoughts. With emotionally difficult topics, there may be brief periods of silence. If you are unsure, it is better to wait rather than speak too soon and interrupt their answer. If they are having a hard time opening up about a painful topic, it’s okay to provide a little encouragement to help them continue speaking. Remember to do so gently, as you don’t want to rush or push too hard.Try using:Watch for Non-Verbal Cues\nMost of what a person communicates comes through body language and tone of voice, not the words they’re actually saying.Notice:One of our greatest needs is to feel connected and cared for. When our bond with others is weak or broken, we feel hurt and lost. In our pain and isolation, we can despair and turn to extreme measures that seem like our only choices. In those dark moments, making a connection or receiving concern and care can be a life-saving event.Don’t let your friends or family go through it alone. When in doubt, reach out. Ask the difficult questions. Follow-up and follow-through.If you or someone you know is in crisis, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (800-273-8255) or text NAMI to 741-741.Kevin Connors, MS, MFT is Senior Vice President at the Hecht Trauma Institute creating trainings on interpersonal trauma, a licensed Marriage & Family Therapist, and a national and international presenter on trauma and dissociation.

      "body": "Each year, more than half a million people arrive at emergency rooms because they are contemplating suicide or because they have already hurt themselves. Despite the care they received, in the year that follows the visit, they are still at a high risk for suicide.Of course, that outcome is a nightmare scenario for their loved ones. In the aftermath of suicide, family and friends often carry the burden of wondering what their role “should” have been in preventing the tragedy.Accordingly, friends and loved ones deserve some guideposts for navigating what to do if someone they care about is at risk for suicide.Predicting when someone is about to attempt to take their life is difficult. Indeed, that task should be left to the treating clinician. Your “job,” however, can involve watching for direct and indirect signs of suicidality and severe distress.Direct signs are when someone you care about says they feel like hurting or killing themselves. Indirect signs are more subtle — the early warning signs that someone is worsening. For instance, they might make negative statements like, “life is not worth it anymore,” or “I am useless.” They may try to gather the means for self-harm, like saving up pills or acquiring a weapon.Beyond noting the harmful behavior, you should not try to determine what the risk is. Rather, you should go directly to them and discuss what you’ve observed. Then, you can contact their clinician or other help. If a clinician is not available, then contact someone respected by the patient, like an authority figure, faith leader or anyone they feel close to and trust. Using this approach, you will be able to gather more information to share with the treatment team.When discussing suicide, remember the following:Naturally, there are times when the situation may get more complicated. What if, for example, you cannot be sure if your family member is being open and truthful with you? This (and other complexities) certainly happen. Rely on guidance from the treating clinician when you’re feeling uncertain.As you help your friend or family member navigate treatment, it’s important that you know what sufficient mental health care looks like. Unfortunately, it’s common for patients to call their clinicians for help and to receive a voicemail instructing them to go to the ER or call 911 for any problems after office hours. This response is a sign that they may need a different clinician.A visit to the ER is necessary in significant emergencies but can often be avoided. Unless urgent action is needed, it is better to work things out with the clinician, as they know the patient and can use the situation as a learning experience to manage difficulties in the future.If the clinician feels a visit to the ER is necessary for safety, then they should make that decision and call the ER in order to give appropriate history and be in touch with the staff there to discuss follow-up.Ideally, a clinician should follow three principles whenever they work with a patient thinking of suicide.Your loved one may also need therapy around a recent crisis, like a break-up, job loss or other interpersonal problem. These interventions are an important part of treatment as they can decrease the pain from certain life events.Ultimately, if they have had significant suicidal ideation, made a suicide attempt, been psychiatrically hospitalized or have a serious mental health condition, then it’s important to be prepared for a crisis.Your role is not to know what treatment your loved one needs or when they need a specific intervention. Rather, it is to be a form of support and connection for them and a form of guidance for their providers. No one knows a person better than their friends and family members, making you an invaluable asset to the treatment team.Dr. Mark D. Rego is a psychiatrist with 30 years of experience.

      "title": "How Mindfulness Helped Me Cope with My Husband’s Suicide",
      "img": "https://www.nami.org/NAMI/media/NAMI-Media/BlogImageArchive/2021/Mindfulness_Blog.jpg",

      "body": "In early 2020, my husband, the love of my life, took his life. He was 34 years old. His suicide was completely unexpected. He left letters revealing that he had struggled with anxiety and trauma his entire life; however, he kept these feelings completely hidden. When he ended his life, there were no visible signs that he was considering suicide, or that he was suffering at all.After practicing yoga and meditation for several years, I had become an enthusiast of mindfulness meditation. Immediately after my husband’s death, I dove deep into my mindfulness practice. I knew that my body was in overdrive, and I needed help regulating the shock of this unexpected, traumatizing loss.What I didn’t realize was the extent to which mindfulness would foster healing and help me process my grief.Mindfulness is a mental state of being aware of what you’re seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting and feeling in the present moment. The practice of mindfulness, then, is making an intentional effort, through breathing or meditation, to get to this mental state.Central to the practice of mindfulness is the release of racing thoughts. As thoughts float in during mindfulness meditation, we welcome them without judgment — and then gently escort them out. When the mind wanders, we aim to come back to our anchor: Our slow and deliberate breath.At first, mindfulness offered me emergency relief. In the days and weeks following my husband’s death, waves of panic frequently washed over me. When this happened, wherever I was — at the funeral home, in the grocery store — I would stop in my tracks, close my eyes, inhale, exhale deeply and focus on the pattern of my breath.Within minutes, sometimes seconds, my heart rate would slow. My chest would loosen. The panic would subside. And inevitably, the rush of tears would release as the adrenaline dissipated.I was safe, even if my life felt like it was falling apart.As time and grief wore on, mindfulness became less of a survival tactic, and more of a mechanism to understand my pain. I designated time each day to pull out my meditation mat and, without judgment, just breathe and observe. Slowly, mindfulness became a vehicle through which I could safely sit with my pain. By gently observing my body and my thoughts as they arose, I gradually opened up to experiencing the difficult emotions and physical hurt of loss and grief.Through this practice, I “got to know” my grief and how it lived in my body. I felt its physical manifestations: tight chest, stomach cramps, clenched jaw, pounding headaches, uncontrollable tears. And I felt the emotional pains: emptiness, confusion, anger, loneliness and the deepest sadness I have ever experienced.I bore witness to my racing thoughts and the endless list of questions — an inevitable aspect of suicide loss. What didn’t I see? Why didn’t he ask for help? How will I live again? And the most painful and frequent of all: Why?!With each inhale, I acknowledged these sensations. Then with each exhale, I released them as gently as I could.With practice, I was able to return to the present: my body, my breath and the solid ground beneath me. Behind the veil, I was processing and healing. But in that moment in time, my only task was to breathe.As I sat with myself day after day, letting my thoughts come in and go out, I began to notice how mindfulness impacted me off the mat.I was thinking more clearly. With time, I began to have breakthroughs in understanding my loss. Among the most impactful was realizing that the pain I carry stems from both my and my husband’s suffering. As I observed, these two threads of pain felt different in my body and, in turn, required different responses in order to heal.The pain that stemmed from my own suffering oscillated from sharp and seething to shocked and numb. I felt abandoned, lost, victimized and deceived by the person I love most in the world. My own pain was anger. It was pity. It was helplessness, emptiness and confusion. My own pain wanted answers.The pain that stemmed from my husband’s suffering was deep and profoundly sad. This pain was rooted in his trauma, and my futile desire to save him from it. This pain stemmed from years of his accumulated anxiety and hidden depression, and from him masking his suffering until he no longer could. This pain was his, carried over to my body.Distinguishing the pain I felt (and still feel) for my husband versus the pain I hold for myself has been critical in my healing. It has helped me recognize intrusive thought patterns related to his death and approach them in ways that better serve me.Making this distinction has also helped me empathize with my husband and his actions. It has allowed me to imagine the gravity of his suffering — while allowing me to separate myself from the aspects of his pain that I could not heal or control.To cope with my grief and process my trauma, I also see a counselor, participate in support groups and turn to family and friends. Still, mindfulness plays its own essential role in my healing.The practice has helped me regulate my stress reactions, keeping my body safe in moments of distress. By following my breath, I have survived the waves of panic that are frequent and even fatal in early grief, especially for survivors of suicide loss. Further, mindfulness is always available: Late at night, early in the morning — moments when my support network typically is not.As my grief evolves, mindfulness continues to be a vehicle through which I express kindness to myself and give gentle space to my broken heart. Through mindfulness, I am making space for my pain with openness and curiosity and learning to coexist with my grief.If you are thinking about suicide, are worried about a friend or loved one, or would like emotional support, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline network is available 24/7 across the United States at 1-800-273-8255 and Suicidepreventionlifeline.org/.Lenore Matthew, Ph.D., MSW, is a writer, researcher and Doctor of Social Work.

      "body": "The highs and lows of bipolar disorder can both be extremely challenging. The name of the illness itself recognizes these two sides (depression and mania), but many people don’t fully understand the role of depression in bipolar disorder. Those who do, like our caregivers and treatment providers, seem to focus solely on the “mania” component of the condition. They often view the highs of mania as the most dangerous states to be avoided and tamed — and they may even find the depressive side to be a relief from the unpredictable highs.However, it’s during the lows that people with bipolar disorder are at the greatest risk of suicide. People with bipolar disorder experience high suicide rates — up to 19% of us die by suicide and up to 50% of us will make a non-fatal suicide attempt — and suicide risk is strongly associated with depressive phases.Personally, I experienced extended periods of suicidal ideation due to prolonged periods of depression. I often explain the sides of bipolar disorder by saying, “It’s the mania that gets you into trouble, but it’s the depression that can kill you.”Given that depression is the more pervasive symptom of bipolar disorder for most people, and given its detrimental impacts on so many areas of our lives, I believe caregivers and providers need to focus more on bipolar depression. Everybody's experience is different, but in my in my situation, overlooking depression has prolonged and worsened symptoms for many reasons:Delays in Getting a Correct Diagnosis\nA depressive episode preceded my first manic episode, so I was diagnosed with and treated for unipolar depression. It was a year before I was properly diagnosed. This is common for people diagnosed with bipolar disorder — and the typical delay in getting a correct diagnosis is six to eight years.The Duration of Symptoms\nI have experienced much longer depressive phases than manic phases, which are relatively short-lived. Depressive phases could last from a few months to years. They were relentless. While my manic phases could be quickly treated with medication, my depressive episodes were difficult to address with medication.The Consequences of Mania\nTypically, after my manic episode, deep depression would set in. In fact, studies show that depressive episodes frequently follow manic episodes. It was a steep fall from the highs of my mania into severe depression.My depression was worsened by the deep shame and embarrassment, guilt and regret I experienced due to my actions while manic. This behavior included frantic rambling emails, often stemming for paranoid fixations, other destructive behaviors, interpersonal conflict and public humiliation. As my mania subsided, I appreciated just how bad my behavior had been, contributing to my depressive symptoms.The Aftermath of Hospitalization\nMy three involuntarily hospitalizations due to manic episodes were extremely traumatic. People with mental illness experience some of the highest suicide rates after psychiatric hospitalization. During the first three months after discharge, their rate of suicide is 100 times the suicide rate of the general population, according to a meta-analysis of studies. The weeks and months following hospitalization were certainly among the lowest points I have experienced in my life.Lack of Caregiver Attention\nMy caregiver expressed extreme alarm over my hypomanic and manic episodes, but relatively little concern over my lows. When I started to become more exuberant, my caregiver was hypervigilant and focused on controlling my activities, insistent that I seek treatment and remain in constant contact with my psychiatrist to prevent a manic episode.During my lows, my caregiver seemed relieved with my inactivity. He seemed unaware of the extent of my struggles, even though he was aware that I was often unable to get out of bed. I felt uncared for, isolated and abandoned, which worsened my depression. He did not insist on treatment and intervention like he did during my manic phases. I believe this contributed to my depression being undertreated.The role of a caregiver in identifying and encouraging treatment of bipolar depression is critical. When we are depressed, we may lack a will to live, we may neglect treatment (such as missing appointments). We can lose hope and even cease communication. Caregivers are the best placed to observe these changes in behavior and activities and encourage treatment.Lack of Treatment Focus\nLikewise, my then-psychiatrist focused their treatment on preventing the next manic episode and hospitalization. On multiple occasions, I explained how severe my depression was and asked them to address it. They largely ignored my concerns. In addition, their treatment approach was highly sedating medication to reduce the risk of mania. This approach further contributed to my depression.I was so highly sedated that I could not work nor have normal social relationships. My psychiatrist also discouraged social activities out of concern for the stress they might cause me, possibly triggering a manic episode. I felt as though the treatment focus was minimizing the suffering of others who had to deal with me rather than actually helping me. I resigned myself to this lesser life, which significantly contributed to my depression.My psychiatrist refused to take calculated risks that could have improved the quality of my life. For example, they did not prescribe antidepressants which they feared might trigger a manic episode. As a result, I believe my depression was undertreated. I believed that there was no effective treatment for my depression which was incredibly disheartening.However, bipolar depression can be effectively treated, and there are medications that have been specifically approved for bipolar depression — some of which have been very effective for me.Activity Being Equated to Mania\nDepression can lead to extreme lethargy and lack of motivation, which can make it extremely difficult to take part in the normal activities of life. Disappointingly, practitioners may view moments of optimism and activity that break through the depression and inactivity as a reason for concern.Our caregivers and doctors may mistake these signs of life for early signs of mania. Their preemptive efforts to prevent the potential manic episode can also reinforce the inactivity. This can keep patients in a depressive state.Ultimately, bipolar depression is ignored, minimized and dismissed all too often. I lost over a decade of my life to depression, which still causes me deep sorrow. It’s even more tragic that so many people lose their lives to suicide.Too often, actions and factors that can worsen depression are considered acceptable in order to prevent mania. This only makes it significantly more difficult to overcome depression and extremely difficult to reach recovery. It is a vicious cycle.I am now happily living in recovery, and I have been relatively depression-free for several years now. Now, my caregiver acts on my depression, my doctor cares equally about the highs and lows and I’m finally on the appropriate medication. Notably, acknowledging and treating my depression also addressed my mania. Since being effectively treated for my depression, I have not experienced a manic episode. I am living proof that the highs and lows deserve equal attention and respect and care.Katherine Ponte is happily living in recovery from severe bipolar I disorder.

      "body": "In psychiatric practice, providers often hear the same concern: “I’ve tried everything, but nothing works.” The patient giving this history could have any mental health condition, but the story is, unfortunately, the same: They put in many years of hard work without much relief.After years of clinical practice and teaching medication use to psychiatric residents at Yale, I have heard this story too many times. Often, people will receive the label of “treatment resistant” without a thorough history review, and, as a result, they can lose hope of getting better.I’d like to share how I evaluate patients concerned with this label — an approach I recommend to anyone who considers themselves treatment resistant.Let’s assume for this discussion that you, your clinician and your past clinicians all agree on your diagnosis. At this point, you may be caught in a spiral of trying newer and more uncommon medications — and you may be stuck in an unfortunate “try this-try that” mentality.What you need in this situation is an extensive review of your history using:Some clinicians may be concerned about the use of a co-reporter, as they wish to protect the confidential nature of their relationship with you. But I’ve found that most people are happy for a spouse, friend or another family member to be part of the team.Whatever you tell your clinician remains protected and confidential, but someone close to you will have a perspective that neither you nor your clinician will have, and this can be invaluable. They may know, for instance, that on a certain medication you seemed like yourself again, or that you were interested in your hobby. It is easy for you (who has experienced many shades of good and bad) or a clinician (who sees you only once a week or less) to miss this vital information.As the information becomes available, your clinician can put together a timeline of your history with special attention to questions such as:Why all this detail? For one, this detailed history of what has happened to you, in one place, is very valuable. You can refer to this document at any time to guide your treatment. It costs less than a CT scan for a clinician to put this together, yet it gives more information about treatments than any test we have.What we are really looking for in this review are holes in your treatment — things that are missing in the care you received. I can say from experience that most cases have significant holes that could mean a patient is not necessarily treatment resistant.Holes come in the following forms:With a second drug:Part of this history may be due to the availability of the clinician. If there was no available contact outside of appointments (that is, no on-call care), they will most likely miss any chances for “hole-fixing.” Often, this is a missed opportunity to make dose adjustments for side effects or inadequate dosing. As a result, a patient will stop a medication due to a side effect or lack of improvement, when either of these could have been taken care of with a phone call.It may be worth searching for a clinician who is willing to make time outside of scheduled appointments for phone calls when needed.I will also mention that during the weeks of this work, you may still not feel well. If safe and appropriate, it is a good idea to treat for anxiety and sleep during this waiting period. This can often be done quickly and has been shown to not only help the patient feel better, but protect against suicide attempts. Make sure to discuss this with your clinician if they do not bring it up.This work can be tedious. But after a few sessions, you can create a plan that is based on your responses to treatments with reputable studies and experience to back it up. Past treatments do not need to be seen as total failures. Each one tells the clinician something about how your brain works and builds the future of treatment for you.This process of gathering information out of any treatment should continue as long as you receive mental health treatment. It is these details that inform your clinician about what will help you the most.Mark D. Rego, M.D., is a psychiatrist with 30 years of experience.

      "body": "In 2019, when I was 35 years old, I was raising a two-year-old son and a four-year-old daughter while battling severe depression, anxiety and an eating disorder. I couldn’t cope with the stress I was under and began abusing my anxiety medication. My symptoms eventually escalated to suicidal thoughts. I needed help, to say the least, and was hospitalized for six weeks.After my hospital stay, which included talk therapy, medication changes and ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) treatments, I returned home hoping for the best. I was fortunate to have a strong support system of family friends, but I still felt so alone and embarrassed.I’d never met (or even heard of) anyone in my community going to a psychiatric hospital. I felt like an outcast, a misfit. Unlike my time in the psychiatric hospital, I didn’t interact with anyone who could relate to my circumstances.One morning after my return home, I read that fashion icon Kate Spade had died by suicide. One of the many articles about her passing claimed that she had battled depression silently because she didn’t want to speak out and hurt her brand.As I read those words, tears fell down my cheeks and something inside of me just broke. That article could have easily been describing me.After reading the article about Kate Spade’s death, I was outraged. My generation was taught to keep quiet about mental illness. Many of us were told to “keep your chin up” when we were struggling; the less fortunate were told to “suck it up” and be strong. Some were even told that mental illness isn’t real.It’s no wonder I ended up where I did. I was suffering with so much pain, and I thought I was weak. I felt scared to share what was going on, and — since nobody else was talking about depression or anxiety — I just assumed I was alone.But I’m not. In 2017, an estimated 11 million Americans adults had one major depressive episode with severe impairment and about 40 million Americans have generalized anxiety disorder. These are common illnesses, whether we acknowledge them or not.At that moment, I decided I was done being silent.I started writing about my journey. When I was navigating my mental health symptoms, I didn’t have guidance on how to approach my health and recovery, so I hoped to be that guide for others. In my writing, I admitted to being hospitalized, abusing medications, self-harming, experiencing suicidal ideation and having an eating disorder.My thoughts and feelings poured out of me, and for the first time in my entire life, I felt free.This writing, which became a blog dedicated to eradiating the stigma of mental illness, had an immediate impact. Readers reached out to me to thank me for speaking up or to share that they lived with mental illness, too.Several of my family members even admitted to facing the same problems, which was eye-opening. Hearing this from family made me feel more “normal” — like my experience wasn’t just a fluke, but perhaps a genetic trait. Ultimately, it helped me to realize that I did nothing wrong.Soon after sharing my story and hearing back from my audience, the heavy weight I was carrying was lightened.Over the last few years, I’ve learned that mental health is just as important as physical health. Now it’s my mission to speak openly, and without the fear of judgment, about depression and other mental health conditions. There is no reason to combat these issues alone, and it can even be deadly to do so. And I plan to keep talking until everyone has access to quality mental health care.It’s ok to talk about your struggles. It’s ok to have a mental health condition. It’s ok to be scared. But it’s important to know that you are not alone in these struggles or your fears.My name is Heather. I have major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, avoidant personality disorder and binge eating disorder. I experience suicidal thoughts. Sometimes, I struggle to get out of bed. I take medication every day.But I am not ashamed. I am not weak. I am not my disease. I’m free.And you can be, too.If you are struggling with a mental health, reach out to your doctor. If you have suicidal thoughts, go to the nearest emergency room or call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 to speak with a trained crisis counselor 24/7 or text NAMI to 741-741 to connect with a trained crisis counselor to receive free, 24/7 crisis support via text message.

      "body": "More than 10 years have passed since our eldest son died by suicide. As I reflect on the first year after his death, I remember how it felt impossible to accept the painful new reality.For years afterward, my husband and I tried to come to terms with our excruciating loss and all that led to our son’s final, desperate act. Mired in grief and guilt, we agonized over the now-obvious warning signs: his social angst and anxiety through adolescence, the inner demons that continued to plague him in college, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder.My inability to heal him, to make him feel safe and whole — what feels like my failure to help him in any “real,” significant way — has haunted me. After all, isn’t a mother’s primary job to make sure her young survive?The path to healing from this loss has not been straightforward. It has required honest introspection, radical acceptance, true forgiveness and unrelenting strength.Remembering My Son and All His Complexities\nI will always think of our son as a shooting star that burned out early. His future seemed so bright and full of promise, yet it all dimmed too quickly. Smart and creative, he was an outsider who couldn’t find his place at the table the way others his age did. He remained at the edge of the crowd, longing to feel accepted, but unsure of where to start.My heart aches for those like him who feel compelled to sit on the sidelines in isolation, overwhelmed by thoughts gone wrong, who see only one solution.Finding a Way Forward with Forgiveness\nOur family was thrown into a pit of despair by this loss. As you might expect, climbing our way out has taken effort and time. Experts call this recovery process “grief work,” for it feels like hard labor, both physically and emotionally.There is no hurrying through the pain, guilt, confusion and desperation. My husband and I struggled with sadness and guilt over losing our son and not being able to get him the support he needed. However, with time, we were able to recognize the ways we had showed up for him.We had tried hard, making sure he always had a warm, loving family around him and access to an array of mental health supports (psychiatrist, psychologist, peer support networks, etc.). Eventually, with this recognition of our efforts, the weight of the guilt lightened and gave way to acceptance and a less self-critical feeling of regret.Another stage of the healing process required admitting and coming to terms with our feelings of anger toward our child for what he did. Through honest discussion, we discovered that we didn’t see our son as just the victim of a violent act, but the perpetrator who ultimately murdered someone we loved. We felt that he had not only robbed himself of his future, but also robbed his family of a future with him in it. However, as we learned to forgive ourselves for his death, we learned to accept and forgive him, too.Accepting Our Scars and Celebrating our Strength\nMy husband and I made it through a figurative fire and crawled out scorched, scarred and transformed. A core piece of my life that was once there is missing — yet sometimes I can still see, feel and hear my son like he’s a phantom limb.Through time, I’ve learned just how strong and resilient I am. I understand, now, that I am a person who can walk this difficult path and bear this heavy weight. Our marriage, too, is sturdier than it has ever been. My husband and I have shared a harrowing experience, but one that has soldered the pieces of our bond together and melded us in ways we couldn’t have foreseen.I will always feel a special connection to people who are also grappling with sadness and loss. Unfortunately, there are many, but they do not need to go through it alone. Sharing our stories and memories, while accepting our new realities, is the way we can move forward and heal.Susan Wight has been a commercial artist and copywriter since 1986, including for clients such as Nolo Press and the National Brain Tumor Foundation.

      "body": "In 2018, more than 63% of college students reported experiencing overwhelming anxiety during their enrollment and nearly 42% reported feeling so depressed that they had trouble functioning at some point during the last 12 months. Some of these students may not have battled a mental health challenge before attending college and might not know how to deal with depression in this new environment.Meanwhile, friends, roommates and classmates often have difficulty recognizing symptoms of depression in students. However, if these peers understand the warning signs to look for, they will be empowered to check in with the college students in their lives who may be struggling sooner and assist them in getting help. Better yet, a familiarity with the warning signs could help curb the thousands of preventable deaths by suicide each year.So, if you want to be an attentive friend or support system for someone dealing with depression — and help your fellow students — keep an eye out for the following warning signs so you can begin a conversation with anyone you may be concerned about.One of the first warning signs of depression is expressing or showing negative feelings or emotions. For instance, someone might reveal they’re feeling sad, anxious or numb, or perhaps they’ll share that they’re dealing with more stress than usual. Others may not express what they are feeling, but it may be obvious that they are feeling more anger, frustration or sadness than in the past. For example, they may have a short temper, exhibit less engagement in conversation and normal activities or experience sudden outbursts.Often, people with depression can’t identify why they’re feeling sad or when they began to experience these emotions. It’s also possible that if you ask more questions about “why” or “when,” they may shut down and become avoidant or unresponsive.What to say:Let’s say you’re concerned about your roommate. It can be helpful to avoid asking too many questions, remind them they’re not alone, validate their feelings, and prepare to listen if they do open up.If you pay close attention, you might notice irregular eating habits in your friend or roommate. Do they skip meals regularly? Do they eat whenever they are stressed? Both undereating and overeating are warning signs of depression.Depression also affects people’s sleep schedules. For instance, if your roommate is experiencing depressive symptoms, they may repeatedly sleep for more than 10 hours a night while someone else with depression might struggle with insomnia.What to say:It’s best not to comment on someone’s eating or sleeping habits, but rather inquire about the underlying reasons they might be engaging in that behavior.Hobbies are a great way to explore your interests and relieve stress while you’re in college. However, students struggling with depression might not care to engage in activities they used to enjoy. They might also avoid social situations, including time with friends.This general lack of interest is a telling sign of depression and can often perpetuate more feelings of loneliness, isolation and sadness.What to say:If your roommate rarely leaves the dorm, offer to do something — or nothing — together.Depression doesn’t always come from specific circumstances, and people from all backgrounds and situations can experience it. Unfortunately, this can cause guilty feelings in students who have “had it good” and still struggle with depression.As a result, these feelings can cause students to spiral because they perceive themselves as a burden or as “incomplete,” which can make symptoms even worse. Therefore, it’s essential to watch out for negative self-talk and twinges of guilt.What to say:Discourage negative self-talk, validate your roommate’s feelings and remind them of their worth.Depression can cause unexplainable pain, chronic illness, and discomfort independent of any injury. Muscle aches and joint pain in the chest, back, neck and shoulders are all potential warning signs.Of course, these symptoms are easy to spot if they’re severe and cause great discomfort. However, if your roommate is avoiding you — or is just really good at hiding their true feelings — you might go weeks without noticing their aches and pains.What to say:Ask about potential injuries or underlying conditions before jumping to conclusions. Then, work together to find ways to alleviate discomfort.If you notice any of these warning signs of depression in college students, it’s crucial that you reach out and encourage them to seek help. Your empathy and concern could save someone’s life, so the sooner you speak up, the better.Ginger Abbot is a college and career writer with a special interest in helping students care for their wellness, mental health and goals.

      "body": "On February 17, 2020, I was at a crossroads, deciding whether I wanted to live or die. After contemplating suicide for two days, it seemed like that was the only answer. I had battled depression for years, but I never told anyone how I was feeling.I was raised to believe that discussing mental health — or any feelings at all — was a sign of weakness. I was told that the only way to address emotional issues was to “get over it.” So that is what I did. But burying the pain and ignoring my feelings, I would come to learn, was not the answer to my recovery or inner peace.I internalized my pain and “got by” for years. I got married, raised a beautiful daughter and began work as a probation officer, which I loved. But in the Fall of 2019, I began to feel different, both physically and emotionally. I withdrew from everyone around me, becoming visibly distant, but always pretending that nothing was wrong.My wife would ask me if I was all right, and I would say yes and come up with an excuse about work or something else. My symptoms, however, continued to intensify; I could feel something was going on in my brain, but I just couldn’t explain it. I was profoundly sad, and I had recurring thoughts of worthlessness. I experienced a constant internal monologue of negative self-talk affirming my low opinion of myself.About two weeks prior to reaching my crisis point, I told my wife for the first time that I wasn't feeling “right,” and I had made an appointment with a counselor. Due to the counselor’s schedule, I would have to wait for weeks for my appointment.I told myself I would hold on — but, again, I was lying to myself. The thoughts of suicide became more intense as the days went by, and I waited for the “miracle” of seeing a counselor. The weekend before my appointment, I became so consumed by thoughts of ending my life that I developed a plan to harm myself.On February 17, 2020, my wife left for work. It was a government holiday, so I stayed home. My daughter was leaving to return to college after visiting home for the weekend. As I watched her drive down the street, I believed that this was going to be the last time I saw her. I started to cry and begged God to help me. I struggled with both wanting and not wanting everything to end.As I grappled with this inner conflict, a voice told me to call someone. I picked up the phone and called the Indiana University Health psychiatric floor. I told the person on the other line that I was in trouble, and he responded by telling me they did not have any beds and to call outpatient services.I followed his instructions, but my call to outpatient services went to voicemail. I called the psychiatric floor back and insisted that I desperately needed help, only to be referred to the local emergency room. Finally, I called my wife and told her that I was suicidal. She came home and took me to the hospital.At the hospital, I completed an evaluation and was admitted to a psychiatric care facility for four days. I was ashamed and humiliated at first. But after the hospitalization and participating in a month-long outpatient treatment program for my depression, I gained a whole new perspective.Being in a support group with others struggling with the same issue was eye-opening — and, frankly, a relief. With the help of this new community, I was able to cope with my symptoms and learn to pay attention to my feelings. For the first time, I truly understood that I had resources and people who cared about me who were willing to help.This new perspective, and my subsequent recovery, would not have been possible if I had chosen to end my life. I took a chance on asking for help, and, as a result, I am still here today. I did more than survive — my life has become enjoyable and fulfilling.Being vulnerable and asking for help is scary, but with the help from the right people, that feeling is short-lived. I hope that by sharing my story of recovery, anyone experiencing symptoms of depression will feel empowered to seek help. I found a way back, and so can you.Joe Dibert is a probation officer, a proud husband to Beth and a proud father to Lauren.

      "body": "The past 18 months have been challenging for all of us, but they have been particularly hard on adolescents. Some lost family members to COVID-19 and others watched their parents lose jobs. Almost all of them were separated, for some period of time, from their schools, their friends and their routines.If you’re a parent, you may have read the recent news articles about the growing mental health crisis among adolescents. As the new school year approaches, we need to know more about which teens are most at risk and what we can do to support them.Nearly all adolescents have been affected by the pandemic, but certain groups are at a higher risk for mental health conditions. To better understand the situation teens have faced, my research team at the Wellesley Centers for Women recently completed a study investigating the factors that made certain teens more vulnerable amid the pandemic.We conducted an in-person mental health screening for nearly 600 seventh, ninth and 11th-grade students at a public school in a Boston suburb from November 2019 through January 2020 (before the pandemic). Then, in May of 2020 (a few months into the pandemic), we followed up with some of these same students and asked them to complete a second, online assessment.We found that, on average, teens’ scores on a measure of depressive symptoms were slightly higher during the pandemic relative to their scores before — but overall, teens reported a minimal level of depressive symptoms at both time points. These low levels of symptoms suggest that, although adolescents may have been experiencing more distress during the pandemic, for many, any increase in negative feelings represents a normal reaction to events around them, rather than a significant mental health concern. This should be reassuring to parents who worry that every teen’s mental health will be irreparably damaged by the pandemic. But to be sure, there are certain groups that are struggling.We found that girls reported significantly more depressive symptoms during the pandemic. Their symptoms fell in the “mild to moderate” range when they were assessed in May 2020. This is consistent with prior research that suggests that adolescent girls are at higher risk than boys of experiencing mental health symptoms in response to adverse life events — and also that girls have experienced higher levels of depressive symptoms during the pandemic than they did before. Our study was limited in scope to a school that was largely white and middle class. But other research suggests that lower educational attainment, financial difficulties, race, and obesity may be associated with more distress during the pandemic.We found that, among adolescents who were more distressed about the effects of the pandemic, those with a more “negative cognitive style” (i.e., a tendency to draw more negative conclusions about the causes and consequences of negative events and self-characteristics) showed greater increases in depressive symptoms, relative to those with a less negative cognitive style. Such cognitive styles may develop when children are exposed to multiple stressful life events (such as abuse and poverty), dysfunctional parenting or when they imitate the unhealthy cognitive styles of their parents.For example, a teen with a negative cognitive style, when confronted with a bad grade in a class, may conclude that they lack the intelligence they need to succeed academically. Teens with a healthier cognitive style may assume that the test was unfair or that their strengths lie in other academic areas.Meanwhile, adolescents who demonstrated greater resilience, as measured by a questionnaire assessing the way they generally manage stressful situations, showed less of an increase in depression, even when they acknowledged feeling distressed about the pandemic.These findings suggest that the risk for developing depressive symptoms in response to distress caused by negative life events depends on individual vulnerability and protective factors. These factors certainly intersect with gender, racial and economic factors; for example, teens experiencing poverty may develop a more negative cognitive style due to the economic hardship they face. But that doesn’t mean that every single teen experiencing poverty will develop depression. We may be able to support teens’ mental health by helping them minimize factors that make them vulnerable to depression and by increasing their resilience.Changing teens’ cognitive styles and increasing their resilience does not mean simply telling them to “toughen up” or think more positively, but it is possible to help teens shift the way they think about events in their lives. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) interventions train adolescents to recognize the connections between their thoughts and their feelings. CBT can aid them in identifying their underlying negative beliefs so they can replace them with more positive “counter-thoughts” (i.e., healthier thoughts that oppose their negative beliefs).Learning CBT strategies can also support teens in becoming more resilient, as they will be better able to manage stress and solve problems that may otherwise lead to negative moods and other depressive symptoms.As our kids return to school this fall, it is important for parents, family members, teachers, guidance counselors and other school staff to be prepared to support them. This transition, though hopefully positive for many, is likely to present its own challenges.Some students preferred being at home without the social pressures of school, afterschool activities and social events. We should remember the lessons we learned over the past year and a half about the importance of sleep, time outdoors and time with family. Also, it’s important to prioritize mental health even when focusing on grades, standardized tests and extracurricular activities designed for college admissions.While these lessons are relevant to all teens, we need to remember that some, who have been more negatively affected by the pandemic, may require special attention. Further research can help us better understand who these adolescents are and what kinds of support they need.In the meantime, we can focus on providing adolescents with the space to process their experience, opportunities for counseling and access to caring adults who check in on them early and often.We have an opportunity to turn the tide of mental health issues that was rising even before the pandemic disrupted teens’ lives. With continued research, we can prepare our kids to face the challenges that come their way.Tracy R. G.

      "body": "When my sister died by suicide five years ago, I struggled to remember her. It wasn’t that I couldn’t remember her face or the way her glasses slid down her nose or her perfectly-formed curls. I struggled to remember her: The way she would dance and make up silly songs, her ability to engage with the people and places around her effortlessly, the comfort her presence gave me.I struggled to remember the essence of Aletha — what made her my sister and an unforgettable part of my life.Perhaps this was because, for more than a year and a half before her death, Aletha was depressed. The tone of her texts and emails changed. Her voice sounded flatter. She got annoyed or frustrated more quickly. Her focus shifted from going on a big trip in a few years to simply getting through the work week.My sister’s death had the cruel consequence of locking that dark phantom of Aletha in my memory. I would tell people how funny my sister was and then I would struggle through an awkward silence trying to think of an example.In the years following Aletha’s death, I would learn to navigate the complex intersection of grief, depression and memory.In those first few months after her death, I remembered my sister’s depression much more than my sister herself. I felt like I had lost my sister twice. First when she died and again when the dark phantom of her depression overrode my memories of her.Shortly after Aletha died, I wrote an article about how depression lied to her. I wrote that depression made her believe that she was worthless and a burden; mental illness had obscured her understanding of her own value and the depth of people’s love for her. Similarly, in the months that followed her death, grief lied to me and robbed me of my memories of the real Aletha.One of the added horrors of grief is that, much like depression, it changes the way we are able to see the world. There’s a term for the way that moods influence our ability to recall certain memories: mood-congruent memory. When we’re sad, it’s easier to recall sad memories. When we’re happy, it’s easier to recall happy memories.The phenomenon is stronger in people with depression. In the midst of a depressive episode, people struggle to ignore irrelevant negative stimuli. The cognitive pull toward negative thoughts is a self-perpetuating part of depression that makes “snapping out of it” all but impossible.When coping with Aletha’s death, I tried harder and harder to ignore my sad memories, and I wracked my brain for happier memories. Each time, though, I couldn’t ignore the painful memories that centered around my sister’s depression and suicide.Eventually, my memories came back — not flooding in one giant tsunami of happy reminiscences, but in a gentle trickle that was often prompted by a word or smell or sound. In the years after Aletha’s death, I would tell stories about her, and most of them reflected the happy and charming sister that I wanted to remember: The person she was for most of her life.Grief never really ends, though. Much like the first months after Aletha’s death, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the accompanying stress and social isolation, made the dark memories much more readily accessible. I was fortunate to have undergone cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) both before and after my sister’s death, as it helped me develop tools to manage my depression and grief.While the phenomenon of mood-congruent memory can maintain moods, “mood induction” is when someone attempts to recall certain memories in order to change their mood.Most research studies involving mood induction involve people listening to happy or sad music or watching emotional film clips; mood induction can also occur through the repetition of phrases or through recalling treasured memories.Before my sister passed, at the suggestion of a therapist, I developed a personal “mood toolkit” that helped me manage stress and negative moods. I leave bookmarks in funny passages of my favorite books. I have curated playlists of music that always raise my spirits. I know which episodes of my favorite shows are likely to result in belly laughs.I’ve also learned few small changes to make when the need is more pressing: Sitting with a tall posture in stressful meetings, unclenching my jaw and hands during difficult conversations. These changes are not likely to reverse depression, but they’re enough to produce a mini mood boost when I need it.In the last year of the pandemic, I’ve fallen back on these tools much like I did during the months following my sister’s death. Since my grief is not so fresh, they work much better now.My memories of my sister often give me insight into my own mood. Hard, stressful days bring back the sad memories. Joyful days elicit happy memories. When the grief is strong or overwhelming, I return to my touchstone memories of joy.Though it has been a very long five years since I last saw or spoke with Aletha, she is still a central part of who I am. She remains a source of comfort and happiness in my life. I keep a list of happy memories of my sister in my mind that still fill me with a warm glow.In my memories, Aletha dances and laughs. She brags about her students. We share meals, and she teases me for my picky-eating tendencies. She listens to show tunes too loudly and drives too fast.In short, I remember the sister I love so much — the sister who loved me unreservedly. I recall those bright memories like an incantation to ward off the darkness, and I bask in the light that was my sister.Eleni Pinnow is a professor of psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. To make sure her sister is remembered for her love of teaching, she has started a scholarship fund in Aletha’s name at her alma mater. She urges those who may be contemplating suicide to call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text “TALK” to 741741 or reach out to the Crisis Text Line (text “NAMI” to 741-741).We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Up until four years ago, I was convinced that I would die by suicide. I made more than three serious suicide attempts that landed me in almost every emergency room or intensive care unit in Chicago.At times, my depression was so severe that I could not walk, sleep or eat. I was fired from one job after another because I was only stable enough to work for a few months at a time. I prayed that I wouldn’t wake up in the morning, and then felt defeated when I’d open my eyes and hear birds singing. All I wanted to do was to escape from the reality of my life, so I often slept for 16 hours a day and actively self-harmed.Looking back, it’s painful to remember how sick I was. My depression created a pit in my soul that often took my breath away. I cried from one moment to the next, seeing despair and death in the most mundane or positive situations.Fortunately, I survived, and I have moved forward and taken control of my mental health. I was able to do this largely because I was willing to ask for help and fortunate enough to receive it. The support from family and friends and expertise from mental health professionals kept me afloat even when I felt I was about to go under for the last time.My survival is also due to several concrete steps that I hope to share with anyone else who may be struggling.My father was a recovering alcoholic, and after seeking help from Alcoholics Anonymous, he was able to stop drinking. His example of courage and recovery lingered with me even in my darkest hours. Because of him, I understood that asking for help was a courageous act.More than once, I allowed myself to be admitted to the hospital. I also agreed to take medications prescribed by a psychiatrist — even when I did not believe medications could work (or, in some instances, when I did not want the medications to work). I even underwent Electro Convulsive Therapy, which seems to have made the most profound improvements in my symptoms.Occasionally, the fog of my depression would lift; when this happened, I made sure the “business side” of my life was in order. I kept my doctor’s phone number within reach. I filed all necessary paperwork with my insurance company, and I filled all relevant prescriptions with my pharmacy.I got in contact with family and friends, letting them know that I appreciated their help, and notifying them of any important developments in my medical regimen. When I obtained an apartment of my own, I put my rent on an automatic payment schedule to cover myself in case I was sick at the time rent was due.While my depression was painful and difficult to manage, I did not suffer in silence. I let people know that I was hurting even though I was afraid I would challenge their patience and unconditional love. This fear, I learned, was unfounded.Family and friends came through for me: My husband cooked for me and accompanied me to all my doctor’s appointments. Friends and family called with encouraging words and visited me in the hospital. My in-laws wrote me letters of encouragement. People did not abandon me as I thought they might; on the contrary, the right people paid attention to my pleas and stuck by me.I feel no shame in having mental illness, and I am glad to be a survivor. I have met so many strong people, neighbors, friends and members of support groups who have created satisfying and productive lives with mental illness. I am proud to stand among them.Since my depression included psychotic delusions, I still have my struggles, but I have many more good days than bad. I continue to see a psychiatrist and a therapist who help me manage my medications and cope with my thoughts and everyday problems.I am grateful to organizations like NAMI that give me a safe space to explore my feelings and meet people who, like me, are survivors of mental illness.Cassandra D.

      "body": "Identifying the pillars of “good” mental health is crucial to improving our mental and emotional well-being.In my work as a psychiatrist and researcher, I have identified seven behaviors that contribute to quality mental health: activity, defense mechanisms, social connection, regulation, human specific cognition, self-acceptance and adaptability.When trying to improve your mental health, it might be helpful to keep these healthy behaviors in mind.During our evolution in hunting-gathering groups, we had to be active to survive. As a result, humans are built for movement and mental engagement — both of which are critical to our overall health. Indeed, when we’re mentally and physically active, we are less likely to be isolated and withdrawn.Typically, symptoms of mental illness include withdrawn behavior and, in the case of depression, reduced activity. However, physical and mental activities (such as exploring nature, socializing, playing sports, creating art or listening to music) improve this issue. As a result, activity can help people with mental illness experience positive emotions and improve their mood.It is human nature to focus on negative circumstances more than positive scenarios. This is because historically, people had to compete for limited resources — and we evolved to prioritize negative emotions, such as sadness and fear, to ensure our survival.When we use defense mechanisms, we can counter negativity and favor positivity. For example, humor is a powerful tool, as it can help us channel and release our negative energy in a constructive way. Other strategies include putting a more “positive spin” on events and detaching from negativity through mindfulness. These methods can help us defend against adverse feelings and circumstances.Research confirms that people require quality social contact for mental health. Accordingly, loneliness proves to be a major contributing factor to symptoms of mental illness.All forms of connection are beneficial, not simply face-to-face human contact. For example, people who feel isolated respond well to finding companionship through pets.However, social connection implies supportive interactions, not just any interaction. Negative interactions, like bullying or spending time with a friend or family member who stigmatizes mental illness, can be detrimental to mental health. To prioritize our mental health, we must avoid these experiences and seek out connection through positive relationships.Emotion regulation is the ability to exert control over our own emotional state. This skill is crucial for maintaining healthy emotions, thoughts and behavior. Many mental illnesses (including depression, anxiety, mania and psychosis) entail “compromised regulation” over emotions and thought processes.Successful emotion regulation diminishes our negative emotions (like sadness, fear and anger) so that positive emotions (like excitement) outweigh negative ones. Equally important is regulating our thought processes to ensure that our thoughts are compatible with reality.Having an awareness of our emotions and thoughts is an essential first step. With that awareness, we can then reframe our negative perceptions and thoughts and replace them with positive ones.Basic cognition, social cognition and motivational processes are powerful — although commonly unappreciated — components of good mental health.Basic cognition largely consists of our “executive functions,” such as attention, organization, planning and multitasking. Social cognition includes our capacity to interpret emotions in facial expressions, understand the intent of others and recognize one’s own role in relationships. Motivation takes various forms, such as striving for knowledge or self-improvement, seeking out friendships or romantic partners and acquiring basic needs like food, water and shelter.Discussions of mental health frequently omit human specific cognition, but difficulties with this type of cognition are evident in autism spectrum disorders, intellectual disabilities, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression. Practicing our executive functions and social cognition (such as practicing reading facial expressions) can help improve these skills.Accepting oneself is a pillar of “good” mental health — not liking who we are has long been associated with mental illness. Self-acceptance is a process that involves both “evaluative” and “perspective” components.Self-esteem refers to our evaluation of our positive or negative value. Self-concept can be viewed as the sum of our beliefs (our perspective) regarding our personal attributes and qualities. Self-acceptance occurs when we have both a healthy self-esteem and self-concept. In other words, we view ourselves positively and understand our own value.When self-esteem and self-concept are negative, mental illnesses, such as depression and anxiety, are more likely to develop and persist. Engaging in strategies, such as self-esteem journaling and writing down positive actions, combined with engaging in fulfilling activity, can help improve self-acceptance.Life circumstances are ever-changing, and our capacity to adjust behavior to align with unforeseen change is crucial for maintaining our mental health. Simply put, life requires flexibility. A lack of flexibility results in unfavorable outcomes contributing to mental illness.Repetitive unhealthy behavior (such as never leaving your house) is a key contributor to recurrent and persistent mental health problems. Conversely, symptoms of mental illness often limit our adaptability; this often manifests in avoidance and lack of motivation. This can create a cycle of unhealthy behavior that is hard to break.Breaking this cycle by repeatedly replacing repetitive unhealthy behavior (not leaving the house) with adaptable behavior (forcing ourselves to go for a walk or meet up with a friend) is essential to maintaining mental health.As hard as it is, sometimes the only way to reduce mental illness symptoms is to push ourselves to engage in these healthy behaviors. Ultimately, when we use these seven behaviors, we are doing the best we can to protect and prioritize our mental health.Dr. Bowins is a psychiatrist, psychotherapist, researcher and founder of The Centre for Theoretical Research In Psychiatry & Clinical Psychology. His work aims to advance the way that key aspects of mental illness are understood, including psychological defense mechanisms, depression, psychosis and schizophrenia, hypomania, personality disorders, repetitive maladaptive behavior, psychological regulation and the true nature of psychopathology.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "Like 2.3% of U.S. adults, I live with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), a largely misunderstood mental health condition that can have a devastating impact. Some international research suggests that people with OCD may be up to ten times more likely to die by suicide compared to the general population. The good news, though, is that OCD can be managed successfully by a behavioral therapy called Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP).Unlike popular media representations of OCD, which depict the condition as a silly personality quirk, OCD manifests much like PTSD. People with PTSD experience intrusive thoughts about the past; similarly, many people with OCD often experience intrusive thoughts about the future.With both conditions, these intrusive fears can take shape in certain behaviors — many of which contradict a person’s core values. These behaviors and can be violent, sexual, religious or relationship-based in nature. The disconnect between one’s behavior and values often leads to crippling distress — and it can even trigger severe behavioral health comorbidities.After an arduous journey to diagnose and treat my OCD, I felt that others seeking help deserved better. As my own recovery progressed, I founded the company that I truly needed in the early stages of my struggles.My journey with OCD began when I was 20 years old, and it turned my world upside-down. I plummeted from being a successful student athlete at a small Texas university, majoring in Chinese and playing quarterback, to hitting rock-bottom in about six months. Misdiagnosis and mismanagement of my condition fueled my descent.I sought care from an in-network Chicago psychologist early on, who misdiagnosed me with generalized anxiety disorder. His recommended treatment plan: Snap a rubber band on my wrist whenever intrusive thoughts appeared. That misguided advice only made my symptoms worse.I ultimately saw four more providers, and each one failed to recognize I had OCD. In the end, my health plan paid these providers tens of thousands of dollars for ineffective treatment, while my mental health continued to decline. I developed severe depression, became housebound and left my school and football career behind.In desperation, I turned to Google for answers. My research led me to a community that was sharing experiences nearly identical to mine. They described how their symptoms improved after trying ERP therapy with an OCD specialist. In an ERP session, a patient gradually confronts the situations that cause anxiety and discomfort. Then, rather than engaging in behaviors to make the thoughts stop (also known as compulsions), the patient learns to sit with the anxiety and accept the uncertainty behind the trigger. Hoping that this treatment might be the answer, I found an out-of-network provider who charged $350 a session and had a seven-month waitlist.Fortunately, the wait didn’t last for months. The provider correctly diagnosed me with OCD and started me on an ERP therapy plan. Despite only seeing the therapist for one hour a week and needing to manage my symptoms alone between sessions, I successfully navigated treatment. After eight months, I was back in school, back on the football field and back in life.I completed my degree and football career at Pomona College in southern California.Shortly before graduation, I was confronted with figuring out what to do next. I thought about that community of people with OCD who set me on the path to a correct diagnosis and effective treatment. I also thought about the hundreds of millions of people globally looking for this path who are unable to find it. But why? It didn’t have to be that way.I was certain that digital technology could help people find a correct diagnosis, connect with other people who have OCD and bring ERP therapy to those who need it.In 2018, I opened the Chicago office for NOCD, a telehealth company dedicated to providing effective OCD therapy to anyone who needs it, regardless of location or financial situation. Three years later, we work with therapists, patients, health plans, providers and employers to transform how people with OCD globally can improve and reclaim their lives.2021 has been a pivotal year for telehealth – both for physical and mental health care. And it need not be considered a temporary solution borne of the necessities sparked by the COVID-19 pandemic (although that certainly accelerated its adoption).For some individuals, virtual behavioral health services can make care more accessible and affordable, while still being effective. These people may decide to adjust their therapeutic plans to stay virtual long-term. However, it is important to note that every person, clinician, and provider company or organization is different – what works for one may not work for another.Moving forward, NOCD will continue to invest in our patient-first focus, with the goal of providing a beneficial and healing experience at every stage of the treatment process.While my road to successful treatment was difficult, I am fortunate to have the opportunity to change this process for others.Stephen Smith is the CEO of NOCD, a worldwide provider of virtual, evidence-based OCD treatment. After a personal struggle with undiagnosed OCD, Stephen made it his mission to create a world where anyone can access effective OCD therapy, no matter where they live or how much money they make.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "body": "By Matthew J. Fleischman, PhD, Henry M. Kaiser, PsyD, MBA and Darla Meulemans, MA, CADCHow many people have tried talk therapy and made progress, but ultimately felt that it wasn’t enough? How many patients have tried medications and still experienced severe symptoms? Probably too many to count.What if there were a way of reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, trauma and attention problems that could complement talk therapy and medication? A new approach to treatment called “neurofeedback” yields promising results of this nature.Now, when we describe this method as “new,” we simply mean that it’s new to the mental health care system. In fact, neurofeedback has been around for over 50 years and has inspired more than 2,400 published papers — and practitioners have used this approach in over 250,000 sessions to date.Neurofeedback addresses problems with mental health from an entirely different direction — by training our brains to better self-regulate.When self-regulation improves, symptoms lessen. Imagine the impact on any individual with a mental health condition if they were able to sleep better, focus better, feel less anxious and react less impulsively. This is why we, The Neurofeedback Advocacy Project (NAP), believe this treatment approach should be widely implemented in more health and mental health care settings.The brain has a physical structure made up of over 100 billion neurons, specialized cells that transmit information. Neurons are influenced and controlled by various neurochemicals, such as neurotransmitters like serotonin, to affect and regulate all of our mental processes. This is the foundation for psychotropic medications: by using a medication to influence the levels and interactions of certain neurochemicals available in the brain, we can affect the resulting mental processes.The brain is also a complex informational network. Electro-chemical information is transmitted between neurons through a vast web of over 125 trillion synapses (the gaps between the cells). In order to perform well, this cell-to-cell communication system must be smooth and in sync. Like any other complex system, it requires constant feedback in order to self-regulate.For example, consider the heating and air system in a building. The thermostat constantly measures the temperature of the room and provides feedback to the system. If the temperature is too high, the thermostat sends a signal to turn off the heat. The brain operates in a similar (although significantly more complex) fashion.The brain constantly monitors its own electro-chemical activities and uses that feedback to adjust. Any issues with that internal monitoring — dysfunction in the neurofeedback system — can result in dysregulation. When stress has disrupted communication within our brain’s network, it cannot effectively regulate itself, disrupting normal functions and impacting mental processes.Our understanding of this feedback regulation system has evolved significantly over the years. Early research focused on “biofeedback,” influencing the body in order to affect different processes. For example, we learned that changing the temperature of a person’s hands could help them relax. One scientist discovered that using milk as a reward could alter brainwave patterns in cats, improving calm focus and ultimately preventing the cats from having seizures.As we learned more about biofeedback, research evolved to focus specifically on the regulatory process of the brain — neurofeedback — and include experiments in humans with a variety of conditions including epilepsy, ADD/ADHD, anxiety, and PTSD.Neurofeedback has come a long way in the 50 years since the initial breakthrough with cats. Now, in a neurofeedback session, the patient sits in a comfortable chair where they either play a video game or watch a movie. The practitioner places sensors, which read brainwaves, onto the patient’s scalp. Over two to three sessions, the practitioner develops an understanding of that individual’s brainwaves, determining what levels and patterns are “optimal” and lead to the most effective functioning.Once the practitioner has identified the optimal brainwave setting for the patient, treatment begins. Specialized software monitors the patient's brainwaves, and when it identifies positive or desired patterns, it alters what the patient sees on the TV screen. For example, boosting the speed of the car they are controlling in a video game or increasing the size of the viewing window for their movie.As the treatment goes on, the patient’s brain automatically adjusts. It “recognizes” that specific brainwave patterns result in positive outcomes (the faster car or better view of the movie) and uses that feedback to adjust its functioning. This self-regulation happens naturally — there is no conscious effort by the patient.During a session, a patient will typically talk to their practitioner about what they see on the screen, share their feelings or respond to questions, which helps the practitioner confirm that the sensor placement, brainwave readings and software actions are correct.At the end of a session, the patient and their practitioner review the recorded progress. The goal is for patients to experience a reduction in symptoms over the course of a typical 20-session course of treatment. By helping the brain “learn” to connect specific brainwaves with positive outcomes, we help it learn to regulate itself, improve overall functioning and support healthy mental processes.While neurofeedback is not a replacement for psychotherapy and medications, it is an excellent complement. Research shows that people who incorporate neurofeedback into their treatment plan feel better able to engage with therapy and implement therapeutic suggestions — and they often need fewer medications.While neurofeedback has been gaining credibility rapidly, recently, it has been available only from private practice providers on a fee-for-service basis. The NAP is working to change this. Our mission is to implement neurofeedback within agencies and healthcare systems, particularly for those who are underserved or difficult to serve.Our hope is for recent advances in neuroscience to improve mental health care and enable providers to rely more on the brain’s capacity for self-healing.Dr. Matthew Fleischman is a clinical psychologist with 30 years’ experience with neurofeedback. He served as an NIH Principal Investigator on a Multi-site Implementation of Treatment of Aggressive Children. He started the NAP by lending neurofeedback equipment to three local agencies serving a range of clients to see how effective the method could be. Based on that experience, the project has expanded to 15 more agencies and is recruiting another 25.Dr. Henry M. Kaiser served as a Director of Kaiser Foundation Hospitals & Health Plan and a Trustee of the Kaiser Family Foundation. His various professional venture capital and entrepreneurial activities have in common the theme of working with innovation in corporate and/or entrepreneurial settings, in technology and in life sciences.Darla Meulemans, MA, CADC has a private wellness practice in Portland, Oregon. Darla's career includes more than 15 years of direct service and leadership in community mental health and addiction treatment in addition to running school and hospital-based programs. Darla provides professional training and mentoring to clinicians using neurofeedback.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

It’s also estimated as many as over 1 million live with invisible wounds of war, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic brain injury (TBI), depression, anxiety and other combat stress.As director of Wounded Warrior Project® (WWP) Talk, a telephonic emotional support program, I’m honored to lead a team every day that helps veterans and their families improve their mental health and well-being.Unfortunately, we know that stigma is often a barrier to talking about traumatic events and mental health concerns, especially for the veterans we help. A critical part of overcoming that stigma is addressing the mental health myths within the veteran community and society as a whole.It’s time we address these misunderstandings and refute the myths. By setting the record straight, we can change the experience of veterans, their families and anyone battling invisible wounds.Myth: I’m broken, and I will never get better.Fact: You are not broken. You are human.Your invisible wounds are not a life sentence. There may not be a “cure,” but you need to know that effective treatment is available and that you are not alone. Through interactive programs like WWP Talk, rehabilitative retreats, clinical care and social support, you can build the resilience you need to overcome your mental health challenges.Myth: No one will understand.Fact: Your journey is unique, but that doesn’t mean others can’t relate to your experiences or help you process your thoughts, emotions and struggles.You don’t have to share the same trauma with someone to talk through what you’re experiencing. However, you do have to take that first step and be vulnerable. There are ways to work through your mental health challenges, and a significant part is being willing to talk about those challenges.Myth: I didn’t “have it as bad” as others, so I don’t deserve help.Fact: Your experiences are valid, and you deserve a safe space to talk about them.It doesn’t matter what your experiences look like, how they happened or when they happened. It’s your trauma, and your recovery matters. You deserve to move forward from this and live a better, healthier life.Myth: Only veterans have PTSD.Fact: PTSD is not a civilian or military issue. It’s the brain’s response to trauma.PTSD can affect any person’s mental health after experiencing any traumatic event — like combat, a natural disaster, a car accident or sexual assault. Veterans have a higher risk of PTSD simply because exposure to potentially traumatic events was a part of the job.Traumatic stress is one of the most common self-reported injuries and health problems among veterans. For example, in the latest WWP survey of the post-9/11 wounded veterans it serves, 83% report living with the symptoms of PTSD. Symptoms include destabilizing thoughts, feelings or dreams related to the events, mental or physical distress, difficulty sleeping and changes in how a person thinks and feels.Myth: Asking for help means I’m weak.Fact: Seeking care for invisible wounds is a sign of strength.Just like people cannot “wish away” symptoms of the flu, veterans with invisible wounds of war cannot wish those symptoms away either. And, unlike the flu, symptoms will not go away with time — a person must seek treatment to start their journey to well-being.Sonal Patel, Ph.D., serves Wounded Warrior Project as director of the WWP Talk program, a telephonic emotional support program for warriors, family members and caregivers. In this position, Sonal oversees the team focused on program delivery with participants managing PTSD, TBI, depression, anxiety and other combat stress.If you are beginning your recovery journey, please know you are not alone. There are multiple organizations dedicated to helping you navigate the challenges of mental health conditions and receive appropriate treatment. Veterans and service members who sustained a visible or invisible injury, illness or wound while serving in the military after Sept. 11, 2001, are eligible for WWP’s programs and services.

      "body": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a mental health condition that includes a pattern of unstable relationships, impulsivity and intense emotional reactions to stressors. The diagnosis is strongly associated with a high risk of suicide attempts and death by suicide. This risk is partly due to the challenges of effectively treating BPD.Following our years of experience in research and psychotherapy, we created a dedicated center specializing in BPD at the University Hospital of Montpellier — the Therapy Center for Mood and Emotional Disorders, which serves as the national standard of care in France.Our research suggests that the root of many symptoms of BPD is a poor, distorted or inaccurate sense of self. In our work helping people with BPD, we have found that third-wave cognitive behavioral therapies (Buddhist-derived psychotherapies), through the practice of meditation, can change self-identification and play an important role in treating this condition.For people with BPD, a sense of self is often based on a feeling of separation or lack of connection to anyone else. This can lead to a lack of satisfaction, security, value and, often, something that patients describe as a distressing existential “void.” As a result, these individuals may feel a desperate need to feel satisfied, secure and valued.So how does this “void” manifest? We explored that question in our research published in 2019. Our answer: Obsessive self-preoccupation and relationship addiction. Faced with chronic feelings of existential void, people with BPD will perceive close relationships as a way to overcome the lack of security and value they feel.The result of this feeling is often engaging in unstable and intense interpersonal relationships — relationships in which the person with BPD will alternate between idealizing someone when things are going well (generating attachment) and devaluing them when they do not meet expectations (generating aversion). Fear of abandonment, characteristic of BPD, can be understood as “the fear of losing the person upon whom my happiness — or my satisfaction, my security, my value, etc. — depends.”In other words, a person with BPD is often dependent on their relationships to feel “ok,” driving the emotional intensity and instability of these relationships. When things don’t work out, the individual with BPD may feel intense emotional distress. Impulsive behavior, including suicidal behavior, then becomes a way to escape the distress as quickly as possible.As we published in the Journal of Affective Disorders in 2019, practitioners and those with BPD should be aware that “if the understanding of self-concept is impaired, all the interventions implemented to decrease the self’s suffering will be subsequently impaired.”Ultimately, our self-perception underlies all our daily experiences. If our self-perception is incorrect, then so will be our perception of our daily experiences — including treatment.Accordingly, we looked into how a person with BPD could improve their sense of self and we found that meditation can be a helpful pathway.Meditation is a way to examine the beliefs and preconceptions we have about ourselves, others and the world. It supplies the tools for each of us to test the validity of our beliefs and develop our awareness. Then, we are able to incorporate that acquired awareness into our behavior, cognition and identity. Therefore, meditation is an act of transforming how we see ourselves.Ultimately, a healthy self-representation established through meditation demonstrates that feelings of well-being, security and value are already present in our own mind.In the realm of brain science, the intersection of modern psychiatry and traditional Buddhism has given rise to Buddhist-derived meditation practices or third-wave cognitive behavior therapies (CBT).Buddhist-derived psychotherapies, through the practice of meditation, aim to change self-identification from an illusion of a “limited self” that is separated from everything that surrounds it, as well as from the feeling of satisfaction, to an understanding of an already content and connected self. At present, there are more than 15,000 international peer-reviewed scientific publications covering this topic.There are three progressive stages of Buddhist-derived practices (BDP) described in scientific literature. In line with the traditional Buddhist “three trainings,” BDP have been categorized into (1) meditation, (2) ethics and (3) wisdom.Meditation: Observing Inner Experiences without Grasping at Them\nMindful meditation involves welcoming each moment and experience with curiosity and openness, without automatic attachment to what is pleasant, aversion to what is unpleasant or indifference to what is neutral.By identifying ourselves as an observer, rather than as a victim of internal and external factors, therapies based on mindfulness meditation can help:The benefit of these practices has been widely studied and demonstrated in several areas of medicine and psychiatry, including treatment of BPD.Ethics: Choosing to Self-Identify with Compassion\nDelving deeper into third-wave CBT/BDP makes it possible to go from acknowledging our harmful automatic behaviors without identifying with them to instead identifying with positive intentions, such as loving-kindness and compassion.Positive states of mind have been associated with greater resilience, and training in familiarizing with these positive states of mind has been associated with increased self-acceptance for people with BPD.Wisdom: Developing an Accurate Sense of Self\nWisdom-based practices aim to develop the perspective that all things and all people exist interdependently. This can help a person think of themselves as a part of something, rather than as an independent being, and, in result, reduce their obsessive self-preoccupation.Third-wave CBT aims to familiarize patients with the power to make the mind peaceful and content, to create and experience happiness and to align ourselves with these positive states of mind. This process can teach us how to turn stressful situations into opportunities to grow: Forming a resilient, empathetic and creative sense of self.Recently, we coordinated a collaboration between an experienced Buddhist meditation teacher and a health care worker team specialized in third-wave CBT/BDP to create a program to help individuals reframe the way they see themselves.This innovative program follows the stages of the path for training the mind described in Buddhism. Each stage has been adapted into a secular format, while retaining its therapeutic function, in order to facilitate a gradual change in self-identification.The preliminary results are very encouraging. Participants described an improved sense of inner well-being, safety and value. They perceived an improved ability to manage emotional states and a decreased urgency to use destructive behaviors. These positive results led us to the inception of a new project focused on providing public mental health workers around the world with online training in third-wave CBT.It is our goal to unite the modern approach of CBT with millennia-old therapeutic knowledge in order to improve the lives of people with BPD.Déborah Ducasse, M.D., is a doctor and psychiatrist-psychotherapist.Véronique Brand-Arpon, M.A., is a doctor of health biology and a nurse-psychotherapist.Together, Ducasse and Brand-Arpon created a dedicated center specializing in borderline personality disorder at the University Hospital of Montpellier in France named the Therapy Center for Mood and Emotional Disorders. Their therapeutic workbook for BPD patients, The Borderline Personality Disorder Workbook: Understanding Your Emotions, Managing Your Moods, and Forming Healthy Relationships, was published in English (translated by Alison Duncan) in June 2021 by Johns Hopkins University Press. Their work was recently presented to the United Nations during the international exhibition on resilience in June 2021 in Geneva organized by the World Health Organization (WHO). This presentation highlighted the efficacy of Buddhist-derived meditation practices in patients diagnosed with mood and emotional disorders, including borderline personality disorder.We’re always accepting submissions to the NAMI Blog!

      "title": "The Truth About Dissociative Identity Disorder",

      "body": "I’ve found that people are usually surprised to learn that a friend or family member (or anyone they’ve known for many years) has dissociative identity disorder (DID). Oftentimes, they expect that such a diagnosis would yield obvious, visible symptoms — behaviors that surely couldn’t be concealed from a friend or relative.DID, however, can be hidden. In fact, only a trauma-informed professional might observe hints of the disorder at all.Since there are, by definition, two or more separate identities present in the psyche of a person with DID, those of us who live with the condition manage a complex inner world that no one else sees. Long before I came to accept that I had five primary alters — or Parts, as I call them — I hid them from myself.I didn’t want to know them; I feared I might have mental illness, and I wanted my Parts to go away and let me be normal. This reaction is common; People with DID are often ashamed and terrified of their symptoms, of finding themselves othered.Now that I am open about my DID, this is what I want people to know.While researchers continue to learn more about DID, experts have come to agree on likely causes. Essentially, DID is believed to be the result of the brain’s effort to protect a person from unbearable trauma in early childhood. In response to severe and prolonged abuse, the personality fragments. DID lets us escape overwhelming trauma, creating other identities to protect us.Because my Parts protected me so well, I did not know of the emotional and sexual abuse I experienced from ages three to seven. My young brain was not forced to confront a horror that it would have been incapable of tolerating.As I grew up, I knew something was “off” — that I was fearful and distrustful — but I did not know why. My brain, I learned years later, created my Parts to carry that burden and to block my memory. My Parts were always protective. Some were inexplicably happy, and another even loved my perpetrator. That Part would later admit to me that her purpose was to keep me from knowing that no one had wanted or cared about me.Decades after the abuse, my Parts, their voices and long-suppressed trauma began “leaking” into my life. With the help of a therapist, I began to find ways to safely tolerate the trauma that was previously unknown to me that I held in my body.Eventually, there came a time that I no longer wanted to get rid of my Parts. I came to understand that they had saved me, and I began to love them. I started the process of “integration,” in which my Parts were no longer separate — and I even held them close. The process included taking on the burden my Parts had been carrying for me.My journey to wholeness examined the nature of traumatic memory itself — how our brains work to protect us when we are most vulnerable and how caregiver-infant attachment and mindfulness impact emotional resilience. It was a terrifying, destabilizing and, ultimately, satisfying process.DID usually, if not always, coexists with one or more concurrent diagnoses. These might include anxiety, depression, PTSD, borderline personality and bipolar disorders, to name a few. PTSD is my co-occurring disorder. While my Parts are now integrated, and they are no longer fragmented into chaotic bundles of raw emotions that engulf me, I still experience flashbacks to my abuse, but I have learned to manage them. Today, I take an off-label, low dose anti-seizure medication that helps dilute the intensity of flashbacks.In my reading I found that 1% of the population may have DID, but most go undiagnosed and untreated. Frequently, a concurrent condition will be treated, with escalating effects on the undiagnosed DID.Finding the right therapeutic fit and developing a trusting relationship with a therapist can take time. My relationship with my therapist was often stormy. I even considered stopping therapy as I struggled to navigate how to be in a relationship, where Parts of me openly distrusted him and sometimes hated him.Over time, I learned to tolerate our conflicts and all my Parts gradually opened to him. From there, we were able to identify damage and begin our work to repair.Desired qualities in a therapist and a therapeutic relationship will likely look different for everyone. Even from a position of profound psychological distress, I knew I needed a therapist who practiced mindfulness in its fullness, whose age reflected their experience, whose depth of listening was steadfast, committed, and honest.People often ask why I didn’t choose a female therapist considering my past traumas, and I can only answer that the therapist I chose was the right person for me — and gender simply wasn’t as significant a consideration. What mattered to me was his mindfulness and his ability to see beyond my diagnosis. As a result, my Parts allowed him into our world, and I learned I was truly not alone.The stigma surrounding DID is formidable and real, and those of us who live with it have an uphill battle in being heard and understood. It seems to me that many people think first of entertainment, of movies and films about sensational characters with “a bunch of different personalities,” when they hear of DID. They do not know about the human beings in pain in their midst.Ultimately, I believe that the only way those of us with DID can eliminate stigma is if our lived experience becomes real to other people. This is a driving force in coming out of hiding to tell my story.Catherine Klatzker is the author of “You Will Never Be Normal,” (Stillhouse Press, 2021).

      "body": "“Your brain is lying to you.”That’s what I told a dear friend when she was experiencing severe depression. The advice was familiar: It’s what I tell myself when I feel my own self-doubt and anxiety taking over.The brain is a notorious liar. Sometimes, these “lies” mean that we misremember something or see something differently from others. Other times, the “lies” our brain tells us influence how we see ourselves. For example, when you are living with a mental illness, you can easily believe that things are awful, that no one likes you and that nothing will ever get better.Here’s the reality: none of that is ever completely true. And the last part is unequivocally untrue — things can always get better.How can I be so sure? I’ve spent most of my adult life managing my mental illnesses and trying to improve my mental health. Sometimes, I keep my depression and anxiety at bay, and I have great months — years even. Other times, I find myself in the depths of despair, and I let my depression bleed into my everyday life, impacting relationships and damaging my self-worth.While I am in a good place now, I know that what works today may not work tomorrow. Maintaining mental health is an ever-changing journey.However, I’ve developed a few truths that guide me in tougher times.1. You Need to Do What Works Best for YouWhile this sounds obvious, distinguishing what actually works for managing your mental health versus what you think should work can be difficult.Thanks to the internet, one click will find you a litany of suggestions for mental health improvement. This plethora of information can be life-changing; however, those suggestions are just a few pieces of a larger mental health care puzzle. For many people, addressing their mental health concerns can be a long process of developing the right combination of therapy, medicine, internal work and activities.2. Bad Times Don’t Equal a Bad LifeWhen you are in the throes of a traumatic or depressive episode, it can feel like there is no end in sight. In this mindset, you can easily make broad-sweeping judgments like, “I have such a bad life.” But it’s important not to mistake a bad time in your life for a bad life.In the past, my brain lied to me and told me my whole life was bad, and I believed it. This lie only made my depression last longer. No matter how bad things are or have been, there is always hope. It may not feel like it, and it’s ok to acknowledge that feeling of hopelessness, but don’t believe that a bad few months or years means that you are unworthy of a good life.3. Your Past Doesn’t Define YouYour past, however difficult it may have been, shouldn’t dictate your future. For a long time, my brain convinced me that I was an emotionally unstable, anxiety-ridden mess. I thought that this characterization was simply who I was, and I would always be that way.But the way you act during one point in your life doesn’t determine who you are forever. People change and grow. What happened in your past can be part of your journey, but it doesn’t have to be who you are.4. Things Will Get BetterI don’t say this lightly. I say this having witnessed several people go through the worst of the worst — yet they are now some of the happiest people I know. I say that as a person who has struggled with mental illness my whole life and always made it out of my darkest times. If you come to understand the previous three truths, this one will follow.5. It Takes a VillageMental health is certainly not a journey you can take alone; it really does take a village. And by village, I don’t just mean your group of friends. I mean your whole circle — your primary care physician, your therapist, your fitness instructor, your neighbor, etc. Not everyone needs to know the details, but it’s essential to have a circle of people who care about you and help you.6. A Good Partner Will Have Your BackI learned (the hard way) that a healthy relationship depends on your partner supporting you during the rough times. Your relationship doesn’t have to be perfect — no relationship is — you just have to know that your partner is making an effort to understand your experience and meet your needs. And if they don’t, help them understand. Voice your concerns or consider couples’ therapy. To make improvements, you have to speak up. (However, if you are experiencing relationship abuse, please seek professional help).In using these truths to guide my recovery, I have come to understand that we are not alone in dealing with mental illness. Millions of people live with mental health conditions — and thanks to a new era of technology and interconnectedness, we can hear their stories and learn from their experience. Perhaps the more we share of our own stories, the more people will speak up and challenge the lies their brain tells them.While it’s scary to share our vulnerabilities, the right people will help. And if you think you have no one to tell, that’s just one more lie your brain is telling you.This post was originally published on The Mighty.
